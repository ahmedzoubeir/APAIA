Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What technique ID is associated with abusing cloud access controls to gain temporary elevation of privileges, as described in the text?,T1078,T1078.001,T1078.002,T1078.003,A,The text describes the T1078 technique, which covers the abuse of elevation control mechanisms, including gaining temporary elevated access to cloud resources.
Which of the following is NOT a method described in the text for achieving temporary elevated access to cloud resources?,Just-in-time access,Account impersonation,Privilege escalation,Passing roles to resources,C,While the text describes just-in-time access, account impersonation, and passing roles to resources as methods for temporary elevated access, privilege escalation is a broader concept and not specifically mentioned in this context.
The text mentions that adversaries might abuse cloud access controls to gain temporary elevation of privileges. Which of the following mitigations is NOT explicitly mentioned in the text?,Limit the privileges of cloud accounts,Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA),Require manual approval for just-in-time access,Review uses of just-in-time access,B,The text specifically discusses limiting account privileges, requiring manual approval for just-in-time access, and reviewing just-in-time access usage. It doesn't mention implementing MFA as a mitigation.
According to the text, how can just-in-time access requests be configured?,Only automatically granted,Only require manual approval,Either automatically granted or require manual approval,None of the above,C,The text states that just-in-time access requests can be configured to require manual approval or be automatically granted depending on the setup.
What is the primary distinction between the technique described in the text and the "Additional Cloud Roles" technique?,The target platform,The timeframe of the access granted,The level of privilege granted,The type of account compromised,B,The key difference lies in the timeframe of access. This technique focuses on temporary access, while "Additional Cloud Roles" involves granting permanent roles.
The text mentions the use of "domain-wide delegation permission" in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Which role allows this type of delegation?,iam.serviceAccountUser,iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator,iam.securityAdmin,iam.securityReviewer,B,The text specifically mentions that service accounts with "domain-wide delegation permission" can impersonate Google Workspace accounts. This permission is granted by the iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role.
Which of the following MITRE ATT&CK tactics is MOST closely related to the technique described in the text?,Privilege Escalation,Defense Evasion,Credential Access,Lateral Movement,A,The technique focuses on gaining elevated privileges, making Privilege Escalation the most relevant ATT&CK tactic.
What is the primary reason mentioned in the text why adversaries might prefer using temporarily elevated privileges instead of directly utilizing highly privileged accounts?,To avoid detection by logging systems,To achieve more stealthy operations,To gain greater access to sensitive resources,To ensure long-term persistence,B,The text states that using temporarily elevated privileges can be stealthier, especially when logs don't clarify role impersonation events.
Which of the following platforms is NOT explicitly mentioned in the text as being susceptible to the described technique?,Amazon Web Services (AWS),Google Cloud Platform (GCP),Microsoft Azure,Microsoft Exchange Online,D,While the text mentions AWS, GCP, and Exchange Online, it doesn't explicitly state that Azure is vulnerable to the same technique. However, the general principles described could apply to other cloud platforms as well.
How does the text suggest ensuring that justifications for just-in-time access are valid?,By reviewing audit logs related to just-in-time access,By monitoring user behavior and activity patterns,By requiring manual approval for all just-in-time access requests,By implementing two-factor authentication for just-in-time access,A,The text specifically mentions reviewing the use of just-in-time access to ensure provided justifications are valid. This is done by reviewing logs related to just-in-time access.
