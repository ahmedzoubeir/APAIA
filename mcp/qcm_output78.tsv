Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is the primary mechanism by which adversaries exploit the PATH environment variable to hijack execution flow?  (Enterprise),Placing a malicious binary in a directory prioritized by the PATH variable,Modifying the PATH variable to point to a directory with restricted access,Using a compromised program's default PATH variable settings,Exploiting vulnerabilities in the PATH variable's search algorithm,A
By placing a malicious binary in a directory prioritized by the PATH variable, adversaries can ensure the OS executes their payload instead of the legitimate one.,The attacker can gain control of the execution flow by placing a malicious binary in a directory that precedes the legitimate binary's location in the PATH variable.
What MITRE ATT&CK pattern technique best describes the exploitation of the PATH environment variable to execute malicious code? (Enterprise),T1055,T1059.001,T1078,T1106,A,T1055 (Hijack Execution Flow) is the relevant technique, as it focuses on adversaries altering the execution path to execute their own code.
Which of the following is NOT a mitigation strategy for path interception weaknesses?  (Enterprise),Enforcing application control policies like AppLocker,Periodically scanning for and addressing insecure path configurations,Disabling the PATH environment variable entirely,Surrounding PATH variables with quotation marks in scripts,C
Disabling the PATH environment variable entirely is not a feasible mitigation strategy because it would significantly hinder the OS's functionality.,Disabling the PATH environment variable would break many applications and scripts that depend on it to locate essential files.
What is a potential indicator of a path interception attack? (Enterprise),Observing a process with a suspicious executable path named after a partial directory,Identifying new files in a system directory that are named like common processes,Detecting modifications to the PATH environment variable Registry keys,All of the above,D
All of these options are potential indicators of a path interception attack, as they are consistent with adversary tactics to modify the execution path.,A suspicious executable path, new files in system directories, and modifications to PATH environment variables are all strong indicators of path interception attacks.
What is the primary purpose of surrounding PATH variables with quotation marks in scripts?  (Enterprise),Preventing unintended whitespace in the PATH variable,Ensuring the PATH variable's integrity against modification by adversaries,Enforcing the use of absolute paths instead of relative paths,Preventing the PATH variable from being manipulated by malicious code,A
Surrounding PATH variables with quotation marks prevents unintended whitespace in the PATH variable, which can lead to execution flow hijacking.,By enclosing the PATH variable in quotation marks, whitespace is treated as part of the path, preventing unintended interpretation and potentially allowing the attacker to execute malicious code.
Which of the following techniques can be used to detect modifications to the PATH environment variable? (Enterprise),Monitoring system logs for changes in the environment variables,Analyzing system calls to identify potential manipulation of the PATH variable,Monitoring the system registry for changes in the PATH variable keys,All of the above,D
All the mentioned techniques can be used to detect modifications to the PATH environment variable. Monitoring logs, system calls, and registry changes provide comprehensive insights into potential manipulation of the PATH variable.,Monitoring system logs, analyzing system calls, and monitoring registry changes are all effective techniques for detecting modifications to the PATH environment variable.
How can application control tools like AppLocker help mitigate path interception attacks? (Enterprise),By restricting the execution of specific programs,By monitoring system calls to prevent the manipulation of PATH variables,By identifying and blocking unauthorized changes to the system registry,By enforcing secure configurations of the PATH environment variable,A
Application control tools like AppLocker mitigate path interception attacks by restricting the execution of specific programs, preventing the execution of malicious binaries placed in the PATH.,AppLocker can be configured to block the execution of programs from untrusted directories, thus preventing the execution of malicious binaries placed in the PATH.
Which of the following is a best practice for minimizing the risk of path interception attacks? (Enterprise),Restricting user access to system directories,Enforcing the use of fully qualified paths when executing programs,Periodically scanning for and addressing insecure path configurations,All of the above,D
All the mentioned best practices are crucial for minimizing the risk of path interception attacks. Restricting user access, using fully qualified paths, and regular scanning for insecure configurations collectively contribute to a robust defensive strategy.,Restrictive access policies, using fully qualified paths, and regular security scans create a layered approach to mitigate path interception attacks.
When monitoring for potential path interception attacks, what is the significance of observing file creations named after common processes in system directories? (Enterprise),It could indicate the presence of legitimate software updates,It might indicate that an administrator is installing new software,It may be an attempt by an attacker to exploit path interception,It is usually not a cause for concern,C
Observing file creations named after common processes in system directories, especially outside legitimate updates or installations, is a strong indicator of potential path interception attempts by an attacker.,The creation of files mimicking system processes within system directories is highly suspicious and likely points towards an attacker attempting to exploit path interception.
How can a security analyst detect path interception attacks? (Enterprise),Monitoring for newly created files named after system programs in directories that are searched by the PATH environment variable,Detecting changes in the PATH environment variable,Observing the execution of processes with suspicious executable paths,All of the above,D
All of these methods are valuable for detecting path interception attacks. Monitoring for newly created files, detecting changes in the PATH variable, and observing suspicious executable paths collectively provide a comprehensive approach to identifying these attacks.,These monitoring techniques enable security analysts to proactively identify suspicious activities and detect path interception attacks.
