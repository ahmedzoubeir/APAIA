Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What technique ID does "Additional Container Cluster Roles" have within the MITRE ATT&CK framework for the Enterprise platform?,T1078.003,T1078.004,T1078.005,T1078.006,C,The technique ID for "Additional Container Cluster Roles" within the MITRE ATT&CK framework is T1078.005.,
What is the primary objective of an adversary using "Additional Container Cluster Roles" within a Kubernetes environment?,To gain persistent access to a container orchestration system,To disrupt normal operations of the container orchestration system,To exfiltrate sensitive data from the container orchestration system,To manipulate system logs to hide their presence,A,The primary objective is to gain persistent access to the container orchestration system by adding roles or permissions to a compromised account.,
Which of the following is NOT a potential mitigation strategy against "Additional Container Cluster Roles" in a container orchestration system?,Implementing multi-factor authentication for user accounts,Using low-privileged accounts to manage container cluster roles,Restricting permissions of low-privileged accounts,Monitoring for unusual activity in role assignments to accounts,B,Using low-privileged accounts for managing container cluster roles is a vulnerability, not a mitigation, as it could allow for unauthorized role modifications.,
Within the context of cloud-based container orchestration systems like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), how can "Additional Container Cluster Roles" be exploited?,By modifying local permission assignments,By leveraging cloud-based role-based access control (RBAC) assignments,By manipulating the container orchestration system's network configuration,By exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying cloud infrastructure,B,Cloud-based RBAC assignments can be manipulated to grant unauthorized permissions to compromised accounts, aligning with the technique's description.,
Which of the following techniques is MOST closely related to "Additional Container Cluster Roles" in terms of its objective within the MITRE ATT&CK framework for Enterprise?,Create Account (T1136),Lateral Movement (T1091),Privilege Escalation (T1068),Credential Access (T1083),D,Credential Access focuses on obtaining credentials for compromised accounts, which can then be leveraged for "Additional Container Cluster Roles" to gain persistent access.,
Which of the following security controls would be MOST effective in detecting potential instances of "Additional Container Cluster Roles" being used?,Monitoring for unusual activity in the assignment of roles to accounts,Auditing user login attempts for suspicious patterns,Analyzing network traffic for unusual patterns and protocols,Monitoring the integrity of system files,A,Monitoring for unusual activity in role assignments to accounts is specifically designed to detect the technique's core activity of adding roles and permissions.,
Which of the following cloud platforms is NOT mentioned in the provided text as a potential deployment environment for container orchestration systems where "Additional Container Cluster Roles" might be used?,Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE),Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS),Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS),Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE),D,While all listed options are prominent cloud platforms, the text specifically mentions GKE, EKS, and AKS, not OKE.,
Which of the following is a common indicator of "Additional Container Cluster Roles" being used by an adversary?,The discovery of a newly created user account with high privileges,The presence of a new cluster role with unusually broad permissions,A sudden increase in the number of administrator accounts,An anomaly in the system's overall performance,B,The presence of a new cluster role with unusually broad permissions is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity related to "Additional Container Cluster Roles".,
According to the provided text, which of the following authentication protocols can be used to secure user accounts integrated into container clusters?,LDAP,SAML,OAuth2,All of the above,D,The text mentions LDAP and SAML as authentication protocols for securing user accounts integrated into container clusters, implicitly encompassing OAuth2 as well.,
Besides the use of multi-factor authentication, what other mitigation strategy is recommended for preventing the successful exploitation of "Additional Container Cluster Roles"?,Enforce the principle of least privilege,Use only cloud-based access control methods,Implement a strong password policy,Regularly audit system logs,A,Enforcing the principle of least privilege aligns with the mitigation strategy of ensuring low-privileged accounts don't have permission to add permissions to other accounts. This directly counters the technique.,
