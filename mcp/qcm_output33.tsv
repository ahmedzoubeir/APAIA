According to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which of the following techniques is NOT categorized under the TA0002: Execution phase?,,Process Injection (T1055),Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059),Remote Services (T1190),Credential Dumping (T1003),D,Credential Dumping (T1003) falls under the TA1003: Credential Access phase, not TA0002: Execution.,
Within the MITRE ATT&CK framework, what is the main purpose of the TA0004: Privilege Escalation technique in enterprise environments?,,To gain access to sensitive data.,To install malware on the target system.,To elevate privileges to gain unauthorized access.,To hide malicious activity from detection.,C,Privilege Escalation (TA0004) focuses on elevating privileges to gain unauthorized access, giving attackers more control over the compromised system.,
In the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, what is the primary difference between the TA0005: Defense Evasion and TA0006: Persistence techniques?,,Defense Evasion aims to evade detection, while Persistence focuses on maintaining access.,Defense Evasion involves removing traces of malicious activity, while Persistence aims to establish a permanent foothold.,Defense Evasion targets user accounts, while Persistence focuses on system configurations.,Defense Evasion relies on social engineering, while Persistence utilizes exploits.,A,Defense Evasion (TA0005) focuses on evading detection, while Persistence (TA0006) aims to maintain access to the compromised system.,
What is the primary function of the T1055: Process Injection technique, as categorized within the MITRE ATT&CK framework for enterprise environments?,,To bypass security controls by injecting malicious code into legitimate processes.,To exploit vulnerabilities in operating systems to gain access.,To remotely execute commands on compromised systems.,To disable antivirus software and other security measures.,A,Process Injection (T1055) aims to bypass security controls by injecting malicious code into legitimate processes.,
The MITRE ATT&CK framework classifies the T1135:  External Remote Services technique under which of the following phases?,,Initial Access,Execution,Command and Control,Credential Access,C,The T1135: External Remote Services technique is classified under Command and Control (C2) within the MITRE ATT&CK framework.,
According to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which of the following techniques is NOT associated with the TA0008:  Command and Control phase?,,Process Injection (T1055),Remote Access Tools (T1021),Data Staged (T1074),Web Shells (T1501),A,Process Injection (T1055) falls under the TA0002: Execution phase, not TA0008: Command and Control.,
Within the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which technique is specifically designed to circumvent detection by security products and analysts?,,T1055: Process Injection,T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1074: Data Staged,T1501: Web Shells,D,T1501: Web Shells is designed to circumvent detection by security products and analysts, as it enables attackers to execute commands on a web server without triggering alarms.,
In the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which of the following techniques is primarily used to obtain sensitive information, such as credentials and data?,,T1055: Process Injection,T1074: Data Staged,T1003: Credential Dumping,T1501: Web Shells,C,T1003: Credential Dumping focuses on obtaining sensitive information like credentials and data.,
According to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which of the following techniques is utilized to maintain persistent access to a compromised system?,,T1074: Data Staged,T1055: Process Injection,T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1501: Web Shells,C,T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter is used to maintain persistent access to a compromised system, as it allows attackers to execute commands remotely.,
