Which of the following malware families is NOT mentioned as utilizing Access Token Manipulation techniques?,Lazarus Group,Turla,TrickBot,Revil,C,The text describes how Lazarus Group, Turla, and Revil employ Access Token Manipulation techniques. TrickBot is not mentioned.
Which of the following is a potential mitigation for Access Token Manipulation based on the text provided?,Limit the "Create a token object" user right to only the local system account.,Restrict the "Replace a process level token" user right to only the local and network service accounts.,Encourage administrators to use runas to elevate privileges when necessary.,All of the above.,D,All the listed options are mitigation strategies presented in the text.
In the context of the text, what is a potential limitation of using API calls to detect Access Token Manipulation?,API calls associated with token manipulation can be used for legitimate purposes by users and administrators.,API calls can only detect the final process creation and not the initial token theft or duplication.,API call monitoring is only effective if detailed command-line logging is enabled by default in Windows.,API calls provide a complete and comprehensive view of all token manipulation activities on a system.,A,The text states that API call monitoring can lead to false positives due to legitimate use by users and administrators.
