What does TCC stand for in the context of this document? ,Transparency, Consent, and Control, Transparency, Communication, and Control,  Trusted, Controlled, and Certified,  Transparency, Control, and Configuration, Transparency, Consent, and Control, The text clearly defines TCC as Transparency, Consent, & Control.
Which of the following methods can be used by an adversary to manipulate the TCC database? ,Using system applications with FDA permissions to execute malicious payloads,  Modifying the operating system to load a controlled TCC database using environment variables and Launchctl,  Injecting code into applications with desired TCC permissions,  All of the above, All of the above, The text describes all three methods as possible tactics for adversaries to manipulate the TCC database.
Which of the following commands can be used to reset TCC permissions? ,tccutil reset, tccreset,  tcc_reset,  TCC_Reset, tccutil reset, The text explicitly states that "user's can utilize the tccutil reset command" for resetting permissions.
According to the text, what is the role of the TCC daemon (tccd)? ,It monitors user activity and alerts security services of suspicious behavior, It manages and enforces the TCC database, It controls access to sensitive system files and directories,  It communicates with the MDM server to enforce security policies, It manages and enforces the TCC database, The text explains that the TCC daemon (tccd) "checks the TCC database for existing permissions."
Which of the following is NOT a mitigation strategy mentioned in the document? ,Routinely check applications using Automation under Security & Privacy System Preferences,  Use an MDM to enforce specific permissions for binaries,  Disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) to allow greater flexibility,  Remove unnecessary users from the local administrator group, Disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) to allow greater flexibility,  The text recommends enabling SIP and does not mention disabling it as a mitigation strategy.
Which of the following is NOT a detection method mentioned in the document? ,Monitoring for changes to files associated with TCC settings,  Monitoring executed commands and arguments that may abuse TCC mechanisms,  Monitoring network traffic for suspicious patterns,  Monitoring for newly executed processes that may circumvent TCC mechanisms, Monitoring network traffic for suspicious patterns, The text focuses on monitoring system activities and files related to TCC manipulation.
What is the significance of the macOS system logs when it comes to detecting TCC abuse? ,They can indicate when the AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges API is being called,  They provide a detailed record of user interactions with TCC settings,  They can identify unauthorized modifications to the TCC database,  They can reveal the specific applications that have been granted elevated privileges, They can indicate when the AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges API is being called,  The text specifically mentions that macOS system logs "may also indicate when AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges is being called."
