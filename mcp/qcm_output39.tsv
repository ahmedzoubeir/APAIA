Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What MITRE ATT&CK technique ID and name are associated with the use of logon scripts to establish persistence on a Windows system?,T1027.001,T1059.005,T1053.005,T1105.002,A,This technique utilizes logon scripts to establish persistence, making T1027.001 (Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts) the correct choice.
Which of the following is NOT a mitigation strategy for logon script-based persistence on Windows systems?,Monitoring for modifications to the HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript registry key,Monitoring executed commands and arguments for logon scripts,Disabling the execution of scripts in the HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript registry key,Enabling Windows Firewall to block outbound connections,D,While Windows Firewall is essential for network security, it doesn't directly address the specific vulnerability of logon script-based persistence.
Which of the following is a potential false positive when monitoring for logon script-based persistence?,A user intentionally adding a benign script to the HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript registry key,A system administrator running a scheduled task,A user launching a malicious program from a USB drive,An adversary attempting to execute a logon script,A,Users might legitimately use the HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript registry key for legitimate tasks, leading to potential false positives in security monitoring.
Which of the following is NOT a known adversary group that has been observed using logon script-based persistence techniques?,APT28,Cobalt Group,JHUHUGIT,KGH_SPY,Zebrocy,C,While all the other groups have been documented as using logon scripts for persistence, there is no evidence of JHUHUGIT using this technique.
Which of the following Sysmon event codes can be used to detect modifications to the HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript registry key?,EventCode 1,EventCode 4688,EventCode 12,EventCode 14,EventCode 13,D,EventCode 12, 14, and 13 are relevant for detecting registry modifications, including those related to HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript.
Which of the following tools can be used to detect changes in the HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript registry key?,Windows Defender Antivirus,Windows Event Viewer,Windows Sysinternals Autoruns,Windows Task Scheduler,C,Windows Sysinternals Autoruns is specifically designed to detect changes in registry keys related to system startup and login, including HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript.
What is the primary purpose of the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript registry key?,To store the user's default login credentials,To store the path to the user's home directory,To store the path to the user's profile,To store the path to a script that will be executed when the user logs in,D,The HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript registry key specifically stores the path to a script that will be executed upon user login.
What is the most effective way to prevent the execution of malicious logon scripts on a Windows system?,Disable the execution of scripts entirely,Disable the user's ability to modify the HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript registry key,Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication,Use a network intrusion detection system (NIDS),B,Disabling the user's ability to modify the HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript registry key directly addresses the core vulnerability of logon script-based persistence.
Which of the following is the most effective technique for detecting the execution of a malicious logon script on a Windows system?,Monitoring the HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript registry key for changes,Monitoring for suspicious processes that start at login,Analyzing network traffic for unusual outbound connections,Analyzing system logs for unusual file access patterns,B,Monitoring for suspicious processes that start at login is a more comprehensive and proactive approach, as it can detect the execution of a malicious script regardless of the registry key modification details.
How does the use of logon scripts differ from the use of scheduled tasks for establishing persistence on a Windows system?,Logon scripts are executed only when a user logs in, while scheduled tasks are executed at predefined times,Logon scripts require administrator privileges, while scheduled tasks do not,Logon scripts can only be used for local persistence, while scheduled tasks can be used for lateral movement,Logon scripts are more difficult to detect than scheduled tasks,A,Logon scripts are executed exclusively upon user login, while scheduled tasks are triggered at specified intervals, making this the key distinction between the two techniques.
