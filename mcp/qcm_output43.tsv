What is the primary function of Startup Items on macOS?,To execute applications and services during the boot process.,To manage user accounts and permissions.,To store system configuration files.,To monitor network activity.,A,Startup Items are designed to execute applications and services during the boot process.
Which of the following is NOT a mitigation strategy for Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts on macOS?,Preventing users from writing to /Library/StartupItems directory.,Monitoring for changes to files in /Library/StartupItems folder.,Enabling full disk encryption.,Monitoring newly constructed processes and command-lines executed during bootup.,C,While full disk encryption is a good security practice, it does not specifically target the mitigation of Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts.
What MITRE ATT&CK technique ID and name represent the adversary's use of Startup Items for persistence?,T1547.001,Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts,T1547.002,Boot or Logon Autostart Execution,T1543.001,Create or Modify System Process,T1546.003,Create or Modify System Process,B,T1547.002, Boot or Logon Autostart Execution, accurately represents the adversary's tactic of using Startup Items to achieve persistence.
Which of the following tools can be used to manage startup entries, potentially enabling an adversary to establish persistence?,jRAT,Metasploit,Nmap,Wireshark,A,jRAT is specifically mentioned in the document as a tool capable of listing and managing startup entries.
Which of the following detection methods would be LEAST effective in identifying suspicious activity related to Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts?,Monitoring for unusual network connections.,Monitoring for newly constructed files by unusual accounts.,Monitoring executed commands and arguments for logon scripts.,Monitoring for changes made to files for unexpected modifications to /Library/StartupItems folder.,A,Monitoring for unusual network connections is a broad detection method and may not be specifically targeted towards identifying activity related to Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts.
What is the deprecated technology that Startup Items have been superseded by?,Launch Daemon,System Preferences,Grand Central Dispatch,Core Data,A,Launch Daemon is the modern replacement for Startup Items, as stated in the provided text.
What is the name of the configuration property list associated with a Startup Item?,StartupParameters.plist,BootOptions.plist,SystemSettings.plist,LaunchAgents.plist,A,StartupParameters.plist is the specific property list file that stores the configuration for a Startup Item.
What is the primary security risk associated with adversaries utilizing Startup Items for persistence?,Elevated privileges for malicious scripts during bootup.,Potential for data exfiltration through network connections.,Denial of service attacks during boot sequence.,Modification of system files, leading to data corruption.,A,Since Startup Items run during the boot process with elevated privileges, malicious scripts within them can have significant impact.
Which of the following is a characteristic of Startup Items that makes them a target for adversaries?,They run with root privileges during boot.,They are easily accessible to all users.,They are primarily used for system diagnostics.,They are only activated after user login.,A,Startup Items execute with root privileges during boot, making them an attractive target for adversaries seeking elevated access.
Which of the following is NOT an advantage of using Launch Daemons over Startup Items?,Increased security through user permissions.,Improved flexibility and ease of management.,Enhanced integration with macOS system services.,Improved performance and resource efficiency.,A,While Launch Daemons offer numerous advantages, user permissions are not a primary advantage over Startup Items. They actually provide more granular control over user access.
