Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is a key characteristic of installer packages that makes them attractive to adversaries for malicious purposes?,Installer packages often include scripts that run with limited permissions,Installer packages are typically distributed through untrusted channels,Installer packages can include scripts that inherit elevated permissions when executed,Installer packages are designed to bypass security controls,C,Installer packages often include scripts that inherit elevated permissions when executed. This characteristic allows adversaries to leverage the elevated privileges to execute malicious content.
Which of the following operating systems uses .msi files for application installation and management?,macOS,Linux,Windows,Android,C,Windows,Windows uses .msi files to manage the installation, updating, and uninstalling of applications.
Which of the following is a valid MITRE ATT&CK pattern technique related to the exploitation of installer packages?,T1055 - Process Injection,T1087 - Execution through Installer,T1548 - Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism,T1127 - File and Directory Discovery,C,T1548 - Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism,This technique directly aligns with exploiting elevation control mechanisms present in installers, allowing adversaries to gain elevated privileges.
What is a recommended mitigation strategy to detect malicious activity related to installer packages?,Implement strict application whitelisting policies,Monitor system logs for suspicious file creations and process executions related to installers,Disabling the installation of applications altogether,Using sandboxing to isolate and analyze suspicious installers,B,Monitor system logs for suspicious file creations and process executions related to installers,Continuously monitoring system logs for suspicious activity related to installer packages, including file creation, process execution, and command execution, can effectively detect malicious activity.
Which of the following is a specific example of malicious activity exploiting installer packages mentioned in the text?,AppleJeus leveraging postinstall scripts to extract and execute a malicious Launch Daemon,The use of .msi files to distribute malicious software,The exploitation of preinst and postinst scripts in Linux package installations,The use of malicious scripts to download and install dependencies during application installation,A,AppleJeus leveraging postinstall scripts to extract and execute a malicious Launch Daemon,This example demonstrates how AppleJeus exploits macOS postinstall scripts to achieve persistence and elevate privileges.
What is a primary challenge in effectively mitigating against attacks exploiting installer packages?,Installer packages are often digitally signed, making them difficult to identify as malicious,Attackers can easily exploit vulnerabilities in operating system components responsible for installer execution,The complexity of modern installer packages makes it difficult to analyze their behavior,Attackers can easily disguise malicious code within legitimate installer packages,D,Attackers can easily disguise malicious code within legitimate installer packages,This is a key challenge because attackers can integrate malicious code into legitimate installer packages, making it difficult to distinguish between benign and malicious installations.
Which of the following is a key aspect of detecting malicious activity related to installer packages?,Monitoring for suspicious network connections initiated by the installer,Analyzing the source code of installer packages for malicious scripts,Monitoring for the creation of unusual files or registry entries by the installer,Analyzing the execution paths and command arguments of processes related to the installer,D,Analyzing the execution paths and command arguments of processes related to the installer,Analyzing the execution paths and command arguments of processes related to the installer is crucial for identifying potential malicious activity, such as unexpected command execution or access to sensitive files.
What is the most effective way to prevent the execution of malicious scripts within installer packages?,Disabling script execution within installer packages,Implementing strict application whitelisting policies,Using sandboxing to isolate and analyze installer packages,Monitoring for suspicious file creations and process executions related to installers,B,Implementing strict application whitelisting policies,By implementing strict application whitelisting policies, only approved applications are allowed to run, thereby preventing the execution of malicious scripts within installer packages.
What is the primary focus of defensive strategies against attacks exploiting installer packages?,Preventing the installation of any applications from untrusted sources,Analyzing the contents of installer packages for malicious scripts,Monitoring for suspicious activity related to installer packages,Disabling script execution within installer packages,C,Monitoring for suspicious activity related to installer packages,The primary focus should be on monitoring for suspicious activity related to installer packages, including process execution, file creation, and command execution, to detect and respond to potential malicious actions.
In a corporate enterprise environment, which of the following is a crucial mitigation strategy to counter attacks using installer packages?,Implement strong password policies for all users,Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions,Use a network intrusion detection system (IDS),Disable the installation of applications from untrusted sources,B,Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions,EDR solutions can monitor for suspicious activity related to installer packages, such as file creation, process execution, and command execution, allowing for timely detection and response.
