Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is a key characteristic of Search Order Hijacking (SOH) that differentiates it from DLL Search Order Hijacking?,The search order is consistent across all programs and methods of execution.,The adversary needs to modify the PATH environment variable to succeed.,The search order is dependent on the program's execution method and location.,The adversary targets specific DLL files instead of executable files.,C,Search Order Hijacking exploits the order in which Windows searches for executables based on the execution method and location. This differs from DLL Search Order Hijacking, which focuses on the order Windows searches for specific DLL files.,
In the context of enterprise network defense, what is the most effective mitigation strategy to prevent Search Order Hijacking?,Implement a strict user access control policy restricting write access to C:\Windows directory.,Use a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) to monitor suspicious network traffic patterns.,Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) to analyze process behavior and identify malicious activity.,Disable the PATH environment variable to prevent any programs from executing outside of pre-defined directories.,A,Limiting user access to critical directories like C:\Windows significantly reduces the ability of attackers to place malicious files in locations that would be searched by vulnerable programs.,
Which MITRE ATT&CK pattern technique best describes the malicious activity of placing a file named "net.exe" in the same directory as a vulnerable program that does not specify a full path?,T1055,Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1087,Execution Through API,T1102,Execution with Unnecessary Privileges,T1127,Hijack Execution Flow,D,T1127, Hijack Execution Flow accurately represents the adversary's tactic of manipulating the search order to execute their own malicious program instead of the legitimate one.,
What is the primary purpose of monitoring file creation events for programs named after Windows system utilities like "net.exe" or "findstr.exe"?,,To identify potential malware installations through malicious installers.,To detect attempts to modify critical system files by malicious actors.,To prevent unauthorized users from running system utilities without proper privileges.,To detect potential attempts to exploit Search Order Hijacking vulnerabilities.,D,Monitoring file creation events for these specific program names allows security professionals to identify suspicious activity related to exploiting Search Order Hijacking vulnerabilities.,
Which of the following is NOT a recommended defensive measure to mitigate Search Order Hijacking vulnerabilities in an enterprise environment?,Enforcing application control policies using tools like AppLocker.,Utilizing a strong password policy for user accounts.,Periodically scanning for and correcting insecure path configurations in system settings.,Limiting user access to critical system directories like C:\Windows\.,B,While a strong password policy is essential for overall security, it does not directly address the specific vulnerability of Search Order Hijacking.,
What type of analysis would be most helpful for detecting Search Order Hijacking attempts based on process executable paths?,Network traffic analysis to identify unusual communication patterns.,File integrity monitoring for changes to critical system files.,Process monitoring for executables with unexpected paths.,User activity monitoring to identify suspicious login attempts.,C,Process monitoring focused on analyzing the paths used to execute programs allows security professionals to detect discrepancies and identify potential instances of Search Order Hijacking.,
Which of the following techniques can be used to identify Search Order Hijacking attempts by monitoring file creation events?,Monitor the creation of files named after Windows system utilities in unexpected directories.,Track the modification of critical system files like registry entries and configuration files.,Monitor the execution of scripts or binaries in the system's temporary directory.,Analyze network traffic for suspicious connections to known malicious servers.,A,Monitoring file creation events specifically for files named after system utilities in locations where they are not expected is a strong indicator of potential Search Order Hijacking attempts.,
Which of the following is a proactive approach to preventing Search Order Hijacking by removing potential vulnerabilities in system configurations?,Regularly scanning for and updating outdated software and libraries.,Implementing strong network segmentation policies to isolate critical systems.,Auditing and hardening system accounts with excessive privileges.,Enforcing the use of strong passwords for user accounts and system administrators.,A,Regularly updating software and libraries ensures that vulnerabilities, including those related to search order hijacking, are patched and mitigated.,
What is the main advantage of using application control tools like Windows Defender Application Control to mitigate Search Order Hijacking vulnerabilities?,They enforce a whitelisting policy, allowing only known and trusted applications to run.,They can effectively block all malicious network traffic originating from compromised systems.,They enable real-time monitoring of user activity and detect suspicious behavior.,They offer comprehensive security monitoring capabilities and alert on suspicious events.,A,Application control tools like Windows Defender Application Control operate on a whitelisting principle, ensuring only approved programs can execute, effectively preventing the execution of malicious files placed by Search Order Hijacking.,
Which of the following is a potential indicator of Search Order Hijacking that should be investigated further?,A user attempting to access a restricted network share.,A newly created file named "net.exe" in the directory of a vulnerable program.,A sudden increase in network bandwidth usage on a specific server.,A failed login attempt to an administrative account.,B,A newly created file named "net.exe" in the directory of a vulnerable program is a direct indication of an attempt to exploit Search Order Hijacking by placing a malicious file in the program's search path.,
