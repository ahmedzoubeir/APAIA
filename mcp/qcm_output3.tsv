What is the command used to set the setuid bit for a file via shorthand naming?,chmod u+s [file],chmod 4777 [file],chmod g+s [file],chmod 2775 [file],A,chmod u+s [file] is the shorthand command for setting the setuid bit on a file.,
Which of the following is a tool that utilizes setuid functionality for high-privilege command execution?,Keydnap,Exaramel,Malleable C2,Metasploit,B,Exaramel, as mentioned in the text, is a Linux tool that leverages setuid functionality to execute commands with elevated privileges.,
Which MITRE ATT&CK technique, if successful, could be exploited by an adversary to discover vulnerable binaries with setuid or setgid bits enabled?,T1083, T1548.002, T1069.001, T1087,A,T1083 - File and Directory Discovery,This technique involves identifying and exploiting vulnerable files, including those with setuid or setgid bits enabled.,
What is the character used to indicate the presence of the setuid or setgid bits when viewing file attributes via ls -l?,s,x,p,d,A,s, The setuid or setgid bits are represented by an "s" instead of an "x" when viewing file attributes using ls -l.,
What command can be used to find files with the setgid bit set on a Linux system?,find / -perm +4000 2>/dev/null,find / -perm +2000 2>/dev/null,find / -type f -perm +4000,find / -type f -perm +2000,B,find / -perm +2000 2>/dev/null, is the command used to locate files with the setgid bit enabled.,
Which of the following is a mitigation strategy to reduce the risk of setuid and setgid vulnerabilities?,Disabling the setuid and setgid bits for all applications,Minimizing the number of programs with setuid or setgid bits enabled,Regularly patching and updating operating systems,All of the above,D,All of the above, are effective mitigation strategies to reduce the risk associated with setuid and setgid vulnerabilities.,
Which MITRE ATT&CK tactic is most relevant to the abuse of setuid and setgid bits?,Credential Access,Execution,Persistence,Defense Evasion,B,Execution, as the abuse of setuid and setgid bits is primarily used to gain execution privileges and run code in a more privileged context.,
What is the purpose of monitoring changes made to files that may perform shell escapes or exploit vulnerabilities in an application with setuid or setgid bits?,To detect attempts to elevate privileges,To identify suspicious activity related to malware installation,To prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data,To enforce data access control policies,A,To detect attempts to elevate privileges, as monitoring such changes helps identify actions that could exploit vulnerabilities in applications with setuid or setgid bits for privilege escalation.,
Which of the following is a valid detection method for the abuse of setuid and setgid bits?,Monitoring file system events for changes in file permissions,Analyzing network traffic for suspicious connections,Monitoring user login attempts,Analyzing logs for system calls related to process creation,A,Monitoring file system events for changes in file permissions, as it can detect when setuid or setgid bits are modified or exploited.,
