Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is the primary security concern related to a "404 Not Found" error page on a web application, from a defensive cybersecurity perspective?,The error page may disclose sensitive information about the web application's architecture.,The error page might be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the web server.,The error page may reveal the existence of hidden or undocumented features of the application.,The error page could be crafted to contain malicious code that exploits browser vulnerabilities.,A,The "404 Not Found" error page, while seemingly innocuous, might unintentionally disclose sensitive information about the web application's architecture or underlying system configurations. Attackers can use this information to plan further attacks.
What is the most effective way to mitigate the risk of sensitive information disclosure through a "404 Not Found" error page?,Employ robust input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent attackers from injecting malicious code into the application.,Implement a custom error page that provides minimal information and avoids revealing sensitive details about the application.,Disable the "404 Not Found" error page entirely to prevent any potential information disclosure.,Use a web application firewall (WAF) to block all requests that result in a "404 Not Found" error.,B,Implementing a custom error page that provides minimal information and avoids revealing sensitive details about the application is the most effective way to mitigate the risk of information disclosure through a "404 Not Found" error page.
Which MITRE ATT&CK technique directly relates to the exploitation of a "404 Not Found" error page to gain unauthorized access to the web server?,TA0001: Initial Access,TA0002: Execution,TA0005: Lateral Movement,TA0006: Command and Control,A,TA0001: Initial Access is the most relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique as exploiting a "404 Not Found" error page could be used as a starting point for gaining unauthorized access to the web server.
Which security best practice is essential for preventing attackers from exploiting a "404 Not Found" error page to inject malicious code and execute it on the client-side?,Enabling HTTPS to encrypt communication between the web server and the client.,Implementing strict input validation and output encoding to prevent XSS attacks.,Using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to control the resources allowed to load on the web page.,All of the above.,D,All of the above options are essential best practices for preventing attackers from exploiting a "404 Not Found" error page to inject malicious code and execute it on the client-side. 
Which of the following security controls would be most effective in detecting an attacker attempting to exploit a "404 Not Found" error page to gain access to the web server?,Intrusion Detection System (IDS),Web Application Firewall (WAF),Antivirus software,Network segmentation,B,A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is specifically designed to protect web applications from attacks, including those targeting error pages. It can detect and block malicious requests that attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the application's error handling.
What is the primary purpose of a custom "404 Not Found" error page in a web application, from a cybersecurity perspective?,To improve the user experience by providing a friendly message instead of a generic error message.,To prevent the disclosure of sensitive information about the web server or the application's architecture.,To redirect users to a specific page when they encounter a "404 Not Found" error.,To limit the amount of information provided to attackers about the web application's structure.,B,The primary purpose of a custom "404 Not Found" error page is to prevent the disclosure of sensitive information about the web server or the application's architecture. This can be achieved by providing a generic and informative message while minimizing the amount of technical details.
Which of the following is NOT a recommended practice for creating a secure "404 Not Found" error page?,Avoid using generic error messages that may reveal sensitive information.,Use minimal HTML and JavaScript code to reduce the attack surface.,Avoid displaying any error details, such as file paths or specific error codes.,Avoid including links to internal resources that may be vulnerable to attack.,D,Including links to internal resources in a "404 Not Found" error page can potentially expose those resources to attackers. It's best practice to avoid including any unnecessary links in error pages to minimize the attack surface.
From a defensive cybersecurity perspective, what is the main concern when a "404 Not Found" error page is designed to redirect users to a specific page?,The redirect URL could be manipulated by attackers to lead users to malicious websites.,The redirect may reveal sensitive information about the web application's architecture.,The redirection process could be used to inject malicious code into the web server.,The redirect could be used to bypass authentication mechanisms and grant unauthorized access.,A,The main concern is that the redirect URL could be manipulated by attackers to lead users to malicious websites. This could be achieved through various techniques, such as XSS attacks or exploiting vulnerabilities in the redirection logic.
How can a security professional ensure that a custom "404 Not Found" error page is secure and minimizes the risk of exploitation?,By implementing strict input validation and output encoding to prevent XSS attacks.,By regularly auditing the error page code for any potential vulnerabilities.,By using a web application firewall (WAF) to block all requests that result in a "404 Not Found" error.,By implementing a custom error handler that logs all "404 Not Found" errors and investigates suspicious requests.,D,Implementing a custom error handler that logs all "404 Not Found" errors and investigates suspicious requests is crucial for ensuring a secure "404 Not Found" error page. By analyzing error logs and investigating suspicious requests, security professionals can identify potential vulnerabilities and threats that might be targeted at the error page.
What MITRE ATT&CK technique is primarily used by attackers to manipulate a "404 Not Found" error page to redirect users to malicious websites?,TA0001: Initial Access,TA0002: Execution,TA0003: Persistence,TA0004: Privilege Escalation,A,TA0001: Initial Access is the most relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique as attackers manipulate a "404 Not Found" error page to redirect users to malicious websites, thereby gaining initial access to the user's device or network.
