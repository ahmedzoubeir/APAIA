Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What MITRE ATT&CK technique ID and name represent the adversary's attempt to establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by user inactivity, specifically using a screensaver?,,T1117,T1547,T1543,T1117.001,A,T1117.001 represents "Event Triggered Execution," and its sub-technique "Screensaver" leverages user inactivity to execute malicious content.,
Which of the following is NOT a mitigation strategy against adversary persistence through screensavers?,,Disabling screensavers through Group Policy,Blocking .scr files from executing in non-standard locations,Monitoring file modifications related to screensavers,Blocking network traffic to the screensaver file location.,D,While all the other options are valid mitigations, blocking network traffic to the screensaver file location doesn't directly address the threat. Screensavers are local files, and network traffic would not be involved in their execution.,
Which Windows Event ID can be used to detect attempted accesses of screensaver files, potentially indicating adversary activity?,,4663,4688,11,13,A,Event ID 4663, "An Attempt Was Made to Access An Object," can be used to monitor attempted access to screensaver files, especially those ending with the ".scr" extension.,
Which Sysinternals tool can assist in identifying changes to the screensaver binary path in the Registry, helping to detect potential persistence mechanisms?,,Procmon,Autoruns,Process Explorer,FileMon,B,Sysinternals Autoruns allows administrators to identify changes made to the screensaver binary path in the Registry, which can highlight suspicious modifications.,
Which of the following is NOT a key aspect of detecting adversary persistence through screensavers?,,Monitoring executed commands and arguments of .scr files,Monitoring newly constructed files with .scr extensions,Analyzing registry changes related to the screensaver configuration,Monitoring changes in the system's default screensaver file location.,D,While the other options focus on detecting changes and activity related to screensaver files and configuration, monitoring changes in the system's default screensaver file location is less relevant for detecting malicious activity. The focus should be on identifying the execution of malicious content, not the location of legitimate files.,
Which of the following represents a valid Sysmon configuration to monitor for registry changes potentially related to screensaver persistence?,,source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="11" TargetObject="\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Control Panel\Desktop\SCRNSAVE.EXE",source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="1" OR (source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4688") | where CommandLine LIKE "%reg%" AND CommandLine LIKE "%add%" AND CommandLine LIKE "%HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\%",source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode IN (13, 14) TargetObject="\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Control Panel\Desktop\SCRNSAVE.EXE",source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="11" TargetObject="\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Control Panel\Desktop\SCRNSAVE.EXE" | where CommandLine LIKE "%reg%" AND CommandLine LIKE "%add%",B,The correct Sysmon configuration focuses on capturing registry modification events related to the "HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop" key, which contains the screensaver settings. This configuration combines EventCode 1 (process creation) and 4688 (registry object access) to capture relevant events.,
In a corporate environment, what would be a proactive measure to mitigate the risk of screensaver-based persistence?,,Use Group Policy to disable screensavers unless they are specifically needed for business purposes,Configure the screensaver to automatically launch after a short period of inactivity,Enable Windows Defender to block any suspicious files from being executed,Implement a strict password policy for all users.,A,Disabling screensavers through Group Policy for non-essential use is a proactive measure that eliminates the potential for adversaries to leverage screensavers for persistence.,
Which of the following statements accurately describes the relationship between the "Event Triggered Execution" technique and the "Screensaver" sub-technique?,,The "Screensaver" sub-technique is a specific example of how the "Event Triggered Execution" technique can be used to establish persistence.,The "Screensaver" technique is a broader category that includes the "Event Triggered Execution" sub-technique as one of its components.,The "Event Triggered Execution" technique is a specific method used to exploit screensavers for malicious purposes.,The "Screensaver" sub-technique is a separate and independent technique, not related to the "Event Triggered Execution" technique.,A,"Screensaver" is a specific sub-technique within the broader "Event Triggered Execution" technique, illustrating how adversaries can exploit user inactivity to trigger malicious code.,
What is the purpose of monitoring newly constructed files that may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by user inactivity?,,To detect the creation of new, potentially malicious screensaver files that could be used for persistence,To monitor the execution of .scr files in real-time,To identify any changes made to existing screensaver files,To identify and block any attempts to modify the screensaver settings in the Registry.,A,Monitoring newly constructed files that may be screensavers (with .scr extensions) is crucial for detecting the creation of malicious files that could be used for persistence.,
What would be a good approach to investigate potential screensaver-based persistence, if an analyst suspects an adversary might be using this technique?,,Monitor the screensaver settings in the Registry for any unusual or unexplained changes,Check for any suspicious files with .scr extensions that have been recently created or modified,Monitor the execution of .scr files and examine their command line arguments,All of the above,D,A comprehensive investigation would involve all of the listed approaches. Monitoring Registry settings, analyzing recently created or modified .scr files, and examining the execution of .scr files and their command line arguments are essential for uncovering screensaver-based persistence.,
