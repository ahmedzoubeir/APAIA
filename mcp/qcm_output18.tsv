Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What MITRE ATT&CK technique ID and name describe the act of adding additional roles or permissions to an adversary-controlled cloud account to maintain persistent access to a tenant?,T1098, Account Manipulation,T1098.002, Account Manipulation: Additional Cloud Roles,T1078,  Privilege Escalation,T1135,  Control Account,T1098.002, Account Manipulation: Additional Cloud Roles,The text explicitly states that adding roles or permissions to an adversary-controlled cloud account falls under the MITRE ATT&CK technique "T1098.002 Account Manipulation: Additional Cloud Roles", which is a sub-technique of "T1098 Account Manipulation".
Which of the following scenarios is NOT an example of the technique "T1098.002 Account Manipulation: Additional Cloud Roles" as described in the text?,An adversary uses a phishing email to trick a user into revealing their credentials and then logs into their account.,An adversary creates a new account with elevated permissions in the victim's cloud environment.,An adversary adds a new administrator role to an existing account they have compromised, granting them more access.,An adversary modifies an existing IAM policy to give themselves more permissions in the victim's cloud environment.,A,The text describes adding roles or permissions to compromised accounts or creating new accounts with elevated permissions. Phishing is a separate technique for gaining initial access, not for modifying account permissions.
What is a primary motivation for an adversary to use "T1098.002 Account Manipulation: Additional Cloud Roles"? ,To establish persistence in the victim's environment.,To conduct reconnaissance on the victim's network.,To steal sensitive data from the victim.,To disrupt the victim's operations.,A,The text states that adversaries use "T1098.002 Account Manipulation: Additional Cloud Roles" to "maintain persistent access to a tenant", indicating that persistence is the primary motivation.
Which of the following security measures is LEAST effective in mitigating the risks associated with "T1098.002 Account Manipulation: Additional Cloud Roles"?,Implement multi-factor authentication for all user accounts.,Use least-privilege access principles for all users and applications.,Regularly audit and review account permissions.,Restrict access to cloud management consoles to a limited number of authorized personnel.,D,While limiting access to cloud management consoles can help, it's not as effective as the other options in mitigating "T1098.002 Account Manipulation: Additional Cloud Roles".  Multi-factor authentication, least-privilege access, and regular audits are all crucial for preventing unauthorized modifications to accounts and permissions.
Which of the following is NOT a potential consequence of successful "T1098.002 Account Manipulation: Additional Cloud Roles"?,The adversary gains the ability to delete sensitive data from the victim's cloud environment.,The adversary gains access to the victim's cloud environment without needing to create a new account.,The adversary can perform actions within the victim's cloud environment without needing to compromise a victim-owned account.,The adversary can easily bypass multi-factor authentication for all accounts in the victim's cloud environment.,D,While "T1098.002 Account Manipulation: Additional Cloud Roles" can grant significant access, it doesn't automatically bypass multi-factor authentication. This is a separate security measure that must be circumvented through other means.
Which of the following logs is MOST useful for detecting the technique "T1098.002 Account Manipulation: Additional Cloud Roles"?,Network traffic logs.,System event logs.,Cloud administrator account usage logs.,Web server access logs.,C,Cloud administrator account usage logs are most valuable for detecting "T1098.002 Account Manipulation: Additional Cloud Roles" because they capture activity related to assigning roles and permissions to accounts, which is the core action of this technique.
Which of the following is an example of a real-world group known to use "T1098.002 Account Manipulation: Additional Cloud Roles"? ,Lazarus Group.,APT41.,Scattered Spider.,APT29.,C,The text mentions Scattered Spider as an example of a group known to use IAM manipulation, which falls under "T1098.002 Account Manipulation: Additional Cloud Roles".
The text mentions that an adversary may add roles to adversary-controlled accounts outside the victim cloud tenant. What does this indicate about the adversary's tactics?,The adversary is attempting to gain initial access to the victim's cloud environment.,The adversary is trying to compromise the victim's on-premises systems.,The adversary is attempting to maintain persistence in the victim's cloud environment.,The adversary is trying to escalate privileges within the victim's cloud environment.,C,This scenario highlights the adversary's objective of maintaining persistence within the victim's cloud environment by using external accounts to perform actions without relying on compromised victim-owned accounts.
Which of the following platforms is MOST likely to be the target of "T1098.002 Account Manipulation: Additional Cloud Roles"? ,ICS (Industrial Control Systems),Mobile,Enterprise,Cloud,D,The text explicitly focuses on cloud environments, including examples of AWS and Azure. This indicates that cloud platforms are the primary targets for "T1098.002 Account Manipulation: Additional Cloud Roles".
The text mentions the use of "Privileged Identity Management (PIM)" in Azure AD. What is the main function of PIM?,To automatically rotate user passwords.,To restrict access to sensitive data based on user roles.,To provide a centralized mechanism for managing and assigning privileged roles.,To monitor user activity for suspicious behavior.,C,PIM in Azure AD is a mechanism for managing and assigning privileged roles, requiring multiple approvals for granting such roles. This aligns with the text's recommendation to use PIM to mitigate the risks associated with "T1098.002 Account Manipulation: Additional Cloud Roles".
