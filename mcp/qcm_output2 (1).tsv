Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What technique ID is used to describe the adversary technique of abusing elevation control mechanisms to gain higher-level permissions within a system, as defined by MITRE ATT&CK? ,T1068,T1069,T1070,T1071,A,This question refers to the specific technique ID used by MITRE ATT&CK to describe the technique of abusing elevation control mechanisms. T1068 is the correct technique ID for this activity.
What is the full name of the technique with ID T1068 in the context of MITRE ATT&CK? ,Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism,Privilege Escalation,System Binary Proxy Execution,Process Injection,A,This question focuses on the full name of the technique described by the ID T1068. The correct answer is "Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism," which is the complete and accurate name of this technique as defined by MITRE ATT&CK.
In the context of MITRE ATT&CK, what platform is specifically targeted by the Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism technique (T1068)? ,Enterprise,ICS,Mobile,All of the above,D,This question asks about the platform focus of the T1068 technique. While the text primarily focuses on enterprise systems, MITRE ATT&CK lists this technique as applicable to both Enterprise, ICS, and Mobile platforms, making "All of the above" the correct response.
Which of the following is NOT a mitigation strategy specifically mentioned in the document to address the Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (T1068) technique? ,Requiring a password for sudo commands,Limiting the number of applications with setuid or setgid bits set,Disabling user account control (UAC) on Windows systems,Checking for common UAC bypass weaknesses,C,This question identifies a mitigation strategy that is NOT listed in the provided text. While the other options are explicitly mentioned as mitigation strategies, disabling UAC is not recommended and can actually increase vulnerability, making it the correct answer.
The document mentions monitoring for specific file system changes as a detection technique for the Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (T1068) technique. Which file system attribute should be monitored to identify potential malicious activity related to this technique? ,File size,File creation time,File owner,Setuid or setgid bits,D,This question delves into the specific file system attribute that should be monitored for potential malicious activity related to T1068. The text explicitly mentions monitoring for files with setuid or setgid bits set as a detection technique, making it the correct answer.
The document recommends monitoring for specific events related to "Get System" elevation. Which of the following events is NOT specifically mentioned as a potential indicator of "Get System" elevation? ,Process creation events with the "C:\Windows\System32\services.exe" parent image and "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" image,Process creation events with the "C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe" image and command line argument ",a /p:*",Security event codes 4688 indicating process creation events,Security event codes 4624 indicating account logon events,D,This question identifies a specific event that is NOT mentioned in the provided text as a potential indicator of "Get System" elevation. While the other options are explicitly mentioned, Security event codes 4624 are not listed as indicators in the context of "Get System" elevation, making it the correct answer.
What specific analytic is provided in the document to monitor for potential "Get System" elevation attempts, a technique commonly used by adversaries to escalate privileges? ,Analytic 1 - Get System Elevation,Analytic 2 - DLL Injection,Analytic 3 - Token Manipulation,Analytic 4 - Process Injection,A,This question directly asks for the specific analytic provided in the document to monitor for "Get System" elevation attempts. The document explicitly provides "Analytic 1 - Get System Elevation," making it the correct answer.
The document suggests monitoring for a specific OS API call that might indicate the use of AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges in macOS systems. Which API call is recommended to monitor for this purpose? ,AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges,AuthorizationExecuteWithElevatedRights,AuthorizationExecuteAsRoot,AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivilege,A,This question specifically asks about the OS API call recommended for monitoring AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges in macOS. The document states that monitoring for "/usr/libexec/security_authtrampoline" executions might indicate the use of AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges, making it the correct answer.
The document highlights the importance of monitoring contextual data about a running process. Which of the following types of contextual information is NOT specifically mentioned as relevant to detecting potential abuse of elevation control mechanisms? ,Image name,User/owner,Process execution time,Environment variables,C,This question asks for a type of contextual information that is NOT specifically mentioned in the document as relevant to detecting potential abuse of elevation control mechanisms. While the other options are explicitly mentioned, process execution time is not explicitly listed, making it the correct answer.
Which of the following is NOT an effective mitigation strategy for limiting the potential impact of the Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (T1068) technique? ,Enabling just-in-time access for privileged operations,Performing regular software updates,Limiting the privileges of cloud accounts,Monitoring Registry settings for unauthorized changes,A,This question identifies a mitigation strategy that is NOT as effective as the other options in mitigating the impact of T1068. While the other options are generally good practices, enabling just-in-time access can actually increase the risk of unauthorized elevation, making it the correct answer.
