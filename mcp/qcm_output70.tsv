Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is the primary goal of privilege escalation techniques employed by adversaries?  ,Gaining access to sensitive data,Executing malicious code,Elevating their privileges on a compromised system,Disabling security controls,C,Elevating their privileges on a compromised system,Privilege escalation aims to increase an adversary's access rights within a compromised system, enabling them to perform actions that were previously restricted.,
What is the term commonly used for the technique where an adversary introduces a vulnerable driver to exploit a system for privilege escalation?  ,Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD),Driver Manipulation,Kernel Exploitation,Kernel Injection,A,Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD),This technique involves adversaries introducing a vulnerable driver, often through initial access or lateral tool transfer, to exploit vulnerabilities and achieve kernel-level access.,
Which MITRE ATT&CK pattern technique corresponds to the adversarial strategy of exploiting software vulnerabilities to elevate privileges?  ,T1068,T1087,T1069,T1070,C,T1069,T1069 represents "Exploitation for Privilege Escalation," directly aligning with the adversarial practice of exploiting vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges within a compromised system.,
What is a common approach used by adversaries to perform privilege escalation by manipulating system processes?  ,Process Injection,Remote Code Execution,Command Injection,Spoofing,A,Process Injection,Process Injection techniques enable adversaries to inject malicious code into legitimate system processes, potentially gaining control of these processes and elevating their privileges.,
Which of the following security measures is considered effective in mitigating the risks associated with software exploitation for privilege escalation?  ,Sandboxing,Firewall configuration,Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS),Network Segmentation,A,Sandboxing,Sandboxing provides an isolated environment for executing code, preventing malicious software from impacting the host system and mitigating the consequences of potential software exploits.,
Which of the following is a potential indication of successful privilege escalation by an adversary?  ,Abnormal process behavior,Network traffic analysis,User account login attempts,Firewall logs,A,Abnormal process behavior,Unusual behavior of processes, such as writing suspicious files to disk or evidence of process injection, might indicate an adversary has successfully escalated privileges and gained unauthorized access to system resources.,
What are the recommended defensive actions to mitigate the risk of exploitation for privilege escalation?  ,Regular software patching,User account lockout,Network traffic monitoring,Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS),A,Regular software patching,Regularly updating software to address security vulnerabilities is crucial in preventing adversaries from exploiting known weaknesses to escalate privileges.,
Which of the following Sysmon event IDs is associated with monitoring the loading of potentially vulnerable drivers that adversaries might exploit for privilege escalation?  ,Event ID 1,Event ID 6,Event ID 4688,Event ID 1102,B,Event ID 6,Sysmon Event ID 6 specifically tracks driver loading events, enabling security analysts to monitor for potential exploitation attempts using vulnerable drivers.,
What is the primary aim of the analytic presented in the text, which focuses on the unusual child process behavior of "spoolsv.exe" or "connhost.exe"?  ,Detecting potential privilege escalation attempts,Identifying suspicious network connections,Monitoring user account activities,Identifying malicious code execution,A,Detecting potential privilege escalation attempts,The analytic seeks to identify instances where "spoolsv.exe" or "connhost.exe" are invoked by a user, potentially indicating an attempt to exploit these processes for privilege escalation.,
Which of the following is NOT mentioned as a specific group known to have exploited vulnerabilities for privilege escalation?  ,FIN6,LAPSUS$,Turla,Zeus,D,Zeus,The text explicitly mentions FIN6, LAPSUS$, and Turla as groups involved in exploiting vulnerabilities for privilege escalation, while Zeus is not listed.
