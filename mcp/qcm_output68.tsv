Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is the primary mechanism used by adversaries to hijack COM objects for persistence?  (Enterprise),Modifying registry entries, Installing a malicious driver, Exploiting vulnerabilities in the COM library, Implementing a backdoor in the operating system,A,Modifying registry entries are the primary mechanism for hijacking COM objects for persistence.,Adversaries modify registry entries to replace legitimate references to COM objects with malicious ones.
How can an analyst detect potential COM hijacking by observing registry modifications? (Enterprise),Monitoring for unusual changes to the HKCU\Software\Classes\CLSID\ registry key, Analyzing changes in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\ registry key, Examining the contents of the HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software\Classes\CLSID\ registry key, Tracking the number of times specific COM objects are accessed,A,Monitoring for unusual changes to the HKCU\Software\Classes\CLSID\ registry key is a crucial detection strategy for COM hijacking.,Adversaries modify registry entries under HKCU\Software\Classes\CLSID\ to replace legitimate references with malicious ones.
Which of the following techniques is MOST relevant to detecting COM hijacking using the MITRE ATT&CK framework? (Enterprise),T1059.001 - Command and Scripting Interpreter, T1064 - Execution, T1069.002 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell, T1078 - Valid Accounts,C,T1069.002 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell, is the most relevant technique for detecting COM hijacking as PowerShell scripts can be used to modify registry entries.,PowerShell scripts can be used to modify registry entries, making it a key technique to monitor for COM hijacking.
Which of the following is NOT a specific example of a malware family that has been observed using COM hijacking for persistence? (Enterprise),APT28, ComRAT, Ferocious, WarzoneRAT,D,WarzoneRAT is not mentioned in the document as having been observed using COM hijacking for persistence.,The document mentions APT28, ComRAT, and Ferocious as using COM hijacking, but not WarzoneRAT.
What is a potential limitation of using event ID 4104 to detect COM hijacking? (Enterprise),It only logs PowerShell commands, not registry modifications, It can be easily bypassed by using alternative scripting languages, It relies on the adversary using PowerShell to execute the malicious payload, It requires additional configuration to capture detailed information,A,Event ID 4104 only logs PowerShell commands, not registry modifications.,Event ID 4104 is specifically designed for PowerShell scripts, not for monitoring registry changes.
What is the primary mitigation strategy against COM hijacking, given the nature of the technique? (Enterprise),Implementing application whitelisting, Deploying a strong firewall, Using anti-malware software, Focusing on threat detection and response,D,Focusing on threat detection and response is the primary mitigation strategy for COM hijacking.,COM hijacking relies on the abuse of legitimate system features, making it difficult to mitigate with traditional preventive controls.
Which of the following scenarios is MOST LIKELY to indicate COM hijacking has occurred? (Enterprise),A previously unseen executable is loaded into memory, The system administrator receives multiple user reports of application crashes, The endpoint's security software detects a suspicious network connection, A known legitimate COM object is replaced with an unknown executable,D,A known legitimate COM object is replaced with an unknown executable is the most likely indicator of COM hijacking.,COM hijacking involves replacing legitimate COM object references with malicious ones.
When monitoring for COM hijacking, why is it important to focus on Registry entries under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\CLSID\ compared to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID? (Enterprise),Because HKEY_CURRENT_USER entries are more likely to be modified by malware, Because HKEY_CURRENT_USER entries are only accessible by the current user, Because HKEY_CURRENT_USER entries are loaded before HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE entries, Because HKEY_CURRENT_USER entries are more difficult to detect,C,Because HKEY_CURRENT_USER entries are loaded before HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE entries.,User-specific COM objects defined under HKEY_CURRENT_USER are loaded before system-wide objects, making them more vulnerable to hijacking.
What is the primary defense strategy against COM hijacking, given its reliance on system features? (Enterprise),Implementing a strong security policy, Deploying a robust intrusion detection system, Using a comprehensive endpoint security solution, Focusing on threat detection and incident response,D,Focusing on threat detection and incident response is the primary defense strategy against COM hijacking.,Since COM hijacking relies on abusing legitimate system features, preventing it through traditional controls is challenging. Detecting and responding to such attacks is paramount.
Which of the following is NOT a typical technique used to detect COM hijacking, according to the provided text? (Enterprise),Analyzing PowerShell scripts for modifications to COM registry keys, Monitoring for unusual DLL loads correlated with COM registry changes, Examining registry entries for existing COM objects for unexpected changes, Scanning for suspicious files in the system's temporary directories,D,Scanning for suspicious files in the system's temporary directories is not a typical technique for detecting COM hijacking.,The text focuses on monitoring registry changes, PowerShell scripts, and unusual DLL loads, not on scanning temporary directories for suspicious files.
