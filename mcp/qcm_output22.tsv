Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is the primary objective of an adversary employing the technique "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution" (T1547)?,Maintain persistence on compromised systems,Elevate privileges on compromised systems,Gain initial access to target systems,Bypass security controls,A,The text clearly states the adversary's objective is "to maintain persistence or gain higher-level privileges on compromised systems."
Which of the following is NOT mentioned in the text as a mechanism used by adversaries to achieve persistence via "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution" (T1547)?,Modifying or extending kernel features,Adding entries to the Windows Registry,Installing malicious drivers,Using custom system services,D,The text explicitly mentions modifying or extending kernel features, adding entries to the Windows Registry, and installing malicious drivers as techniques used by adversaries. Custom system services are not mentioned.
Which of the following is a valid approach for detecting the technique "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution" (T1547)?,Monitoring file creation events,Analyzing system logs for suspicious API calls,Analyzing kernel driver installation activity,All of the above,D,The text lists several detection approaches, including monitoring file creation events, analyzing system logs for suspicious API calls, and analyzing kernel driver installation activity.
According to the text, what is a potential limitation of using preventive controls to mitigate the technique "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution" (T1547)?,Preventive controls are often ineffective against zero-day exploits,Preventive controls are not effective against all types of attacks,Preventive controls are too expensive to implement,Preventive controls are difficult to configure,B,The text states that this type of attack cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls because it is based on the abuse of system features.
Which of the following is NOT a specific example of the technique "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution" (T1547) mentioned in the text?,BoxCaon established persistence by setting the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\load registry key to point to its executable,Dtrackâ€™s RAT makes a persistent target file with auto execution on the host start,Mis-Type has created registry keys for persistence, including HKCU\Software\bkfouerioyou, HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{6afa8072-b2b1-31a8-b5c1-{Unique Identifier}, and HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{3BF41072-B2B1-31A8-B5C1-{Unique Identifier},xCaon has added persistence via the Registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\load which causes the malware to run each time any user logs in,None of the above,D,All the examples provided are specific instances of the technique "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution" (T1547).
Which of the following scenarios would be most indicative of the technique "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution" (T1547)?,An adversary uses a vulnerability in a network device to gain access to the internal network,An adversary exploits a vulnerability in a web application to steal user credentials,An adversary creates a scheduled task that runs a malicious program at a specific time,An adversary modifies the system's boot configuration to automatically execute a malicious program,D,The scenario describes an adversary directly modifying the system's boot configuration to execute a malicious program, which is a clear example of the "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution" (T1547) technique.
The text mentions that monitoring executed commands and arguments is a useful detection approach for "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution" (T1547). Which of the following command-line arguments would be particularly suspicious in this context?,-install, -s, -r, -p,C,The command-line argument "-r" (often used for "run" or "register") can indicate attempts to register a program or script for automatic execution during boot or logon. The other options are less specifically related to autostart execution.
Which of the following is a potential mitigation strategy for the technique "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution" (T1547), despite the limitations mentioned in the text?,Restricting the use of administrative accounts,Implementing strong authentication controls,Using anti-virus software with up-to-date signatures,All of the above,D,While the text mentions limitations of preventive controls, all the listed options can contribute to mitigating the technique. Restricting administrative accounts, implementing strong authentication controls, and using antivirus software can help reduce the success rate of this technique.
What is the MITRE ATT&CK tactic that the technique "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution" (T1547) falls under?,Persistence,Privilege Escalation,Lateral Movement,Command and Control,A,The text explicitly states that the adversary's objective is "to maintain persistence or gain higher-level privileges on compromised systems." This aligns with the Persistence tactic in MITRE ATT&CK.
