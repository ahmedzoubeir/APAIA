Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is the primary purpose of Kernel Modules and Extensions (LKMs and kexts) in the context of operating systems?,Extending the functionality of the kernel without rebooting,Providing root access to non-privileged users,Preventing unauthorized kernel modifications,Enabling secure communication between kernel and user space,A,Kernel Modules and Extensions are designed to enhance the kernel's capabilities without requiring a system restart.
In the context of MITRE ATT&CK, which technique ID and name correspond to the malicious use of Kernel Modules and Extensions to achieve persistence or privilege escalation?,T1547.001, Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Kernel Modules and Extensions,T1543,  Data from Configuration Management and Monitoring Tools,T1548,  Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism,T1059.005,  Command and Scripting Interpreter,A,This question specifically asks about the MITRE ATT&CK technique that relates to using kernel modules for persistence or privilege escalation. T1547.001 directly aligns with this description.
Which of the following is NOT a common feature of LKM-based rootkits?,Hiding files, processes, and network activity,Enabling root access to non-privileged users,Tampering with system logs,Creating new user accounts with administrative privileges,D,LKM-based rootkits are known for hiding system information, granting unauthorized access, and manipulating logs. They typically don't focus on creating new user accounts as part of their core functionality.
According to the provided text, what is the purpose of the kextload and kextunload commands in macOS?,To manage the loading and unloading of kernel extensions,To disable system integrity protection (SIP),To verify the digital signature of kernel extensions,To detect and remove malicious kernel modules,A,The text explicitly mentions that kextload and kextunload commands are used to manage the loading and unloading of kernel extensions.
What security measure can help mitigate the risk of malicious Kernel Module (LKM) loading?,Enabling System Integrity Protection (SIP) on macOS,Disabling the root account,Employing application control and software restriction tools,All of the above,D,Each of the listed options contributes to mitigating the risk of malicious LKM loading: SIP on macOS strengthens security, disabling the root account limits potential abuse, and application control tools restrict the loading of unauthorized modules.
In the context of MITRE ATT&CK, which platform is primarily targeted by the "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Kernel Modules and Extensions" technique?,Enterprise,ICS,Mobile,All of the above,A,While the technique can be applicable across platforms, the provided text focuses on the use of kernel modules and extensions in operating systems like Linux and macOS, typically found in the Enterprise environment.
Which command would you monitor on a Linux system to detect potential attempts to load malicious Kernel Modules?,netstat,ps,lsmod,top,C,The command 'lsmod' is specifically used to list loaded kernel modules, making it an ideal tool for monitoring for potential malicious module loading.
What is the purpose of the "KextPolicy" database in macOS?,To store a list of user-approved kernel extensions,To track the execution history of kernel extensions,To enforce digital signature verification on all kernel extensions,To prevent the loading of legacy kernel extensions,A,The text states that KextPolicy stores a list of user-approved (non-Apple) kernel extensions, indicating its primary function as a database for authorized extensions.
Which of the following tools is NOT specifically designed for detecting Linux rootkits?,rkhunter,chrootkit,iptables,SELinux,C,iptables is a firewall tool used for network packet filtering, not specifically designed for detecting rootkits. The other options are rootkit detection tools.
What is the significance of monitoring for newly constructed files in the "/lib/modules" directory on a Linux system?,It can indicate an attempt to create new kernel modules,It can reveal the presence of recently installed system updates,It can track the creation of new system libraries,It can identify recently modified system configuration files,A,The text mentions that Kernel Modules (LKMs) are typically loaded into the "/lib/modules" directory, making it a key location to monitor for newly constructed files that might indicate malicious module creation.
