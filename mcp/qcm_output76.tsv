Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is a primary defensive strategy against "Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness" in the context of enterprise security? ,Implementing application whitelisting to restrict executable installations to approved software,Monitoring user activity for unusual file downloads and executions,Conducting regular vulnerability assessments of critical system components,Implementing strict file system permissions to limit access to sensitive directories,D,Implementing strict file system permissions to limit access to sensitive directories.,This technique specifically targets weaknesses in file system permissions, so limiting access through strict permissions is the most direct defense.,
What MITRE ATT&CK technique does "Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness" most closely resemble? ,Privilege Escalation: T1068,Execution: T1059,Defense Evasion: T1070,Lateral Movement: T1071,A,Privilege Escalation: T1068,The attack seeks to elevate privileges by replacing binaries, which is a core aspect of privilege escalation.,
Which of the following is NOT a typical characteristic of an attacker using the "Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness" technique? ,They may use tools like PowerSploit to assess file system permissions,They will typically target systems with weak user account controls,They may focus on leveraging user-level permissions to overwrite sensitive binaries,They will typically attempt to bypass antivirus software using obfuscation techniques,D,They will typically attempt to bypass antivirus software using obfuscation techniques,While bypass is possible, this technique relies on exploiting existing permissions and vulnerabilities rather than directly circumventing security tools like antivirus.,
Which of the following detection methods is NOT specifically mentioned as useful against "Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness"? ,Monitoring for newly constructed files matching existing service executables,Analyzing network traffic for unusual patterns related to file transfers,Monitoring DLL/PE file events, especially creation and loading,Monitoring for abnormal process call trees from typical processes and services,B,Analyzing network traffic for unusual patterns related to file transfers,This technique focuses on file system manipulation and process execution, while network traffic analysis might be useful in other scenarios.,
Which specific MITRE ATT&CK technique can be leveraged to detect the exploitation of "Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness"? ,Process Injection: T1055,Process Discovery: T1083,Credential Dumping: T1003,User Execution: T1089,B,Process Discovery: T1083,Monitoring for abnormal process behavior, such as unexpected service executables, is a core aspect of process discovery techniques.,
What does the recommended registry setting "ConsentPromptBehaviorUser"=dword:00000000 aim to achieve in the context of "Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness"? ,Disable User Account Control (UAC) entirely for all users,Force a password prompt for all installer executions,Prevent privilege escalation by disabling installer detection,Automatically deny all elevation requests for standard users,D,Automatically deny all elevation requests for standard users,This setting specifically aims to block elevation attempts by standard users, preventing potential privilege escalation.,
What is a potential risk associated with disabling installer detection using "EnableInstallerDetection"=dword:00000000? ,It will prevent successful installation of legitimate software,It may hinder the ability to log installation attempts,It can lead to a denial-of-service attack during the installation process,It can expose the system to vulnerabilities related to unpatched software,B,It may hinder the ability to log installation attempts,Disabling detection disables logging, which can make it harder to track suspicious installation attempts.,
In the context of mitigating "Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness", why is limiting privileges of user accounts and groups important? ,It prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data,It restricts the ability of malicious users to gain elevated privileges,It makes it harder for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in the system,It reduces the likelihood of successful phishing attacks,B,It restricts the ability of malicious users to gain elevated privileges,By limiting privileges, it becomes more difficult for attackers to exploit file system permissions to elevate their access level and execute malicious code.,
Which of the following statements accurately reflects the relationship between "Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness" and "DLL Search Order Hijacking"? ,The former exploits vulnerabilities in the DLL search order, while the latter targets installer permissions,They are independent techniques with no significant overlap,Both techniques leverage vulnerabilities related to file system permissions,The former is a more sophisticated version of the latter,C,Both techniques leverage vulnerabilities related to file system permissions,Both techniques exploit vulnerabilities in how files are loaded and executed, often relying on weaknesses in file system permissions.,
What is the primary goal of monitoring for newly constructed processes matching existing service executables in the context of "Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness"? ,Identifying suspicious processes that may be attempting to gain access to system resources,Detecting attempts to replace legitimate service executables with malicious ones,Monitoring for abnormal process termination events,Analyzing network traffic for suspicious connections,B,Detecting attempts to replace legitimate service executables with malicious ones,This specific monitoring activity aims to identify instances where a malicious binary has been substituted for a legitimate service executable.,
