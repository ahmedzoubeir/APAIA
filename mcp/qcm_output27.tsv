Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What MITRE ATT&CK technique ID and name represent the abuse of security support providers (SSPs) to execute DLLs when the system boots?,T1547.001, Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Security Support Provider, T1548.002, Process Injection: Dynamic-Link Library Injection, T1059.005, Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell,T1055.003, Process Discovery:  Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI),B,The technique specifically describes exploiting SSPs during system startup to execute DLLs, aligning with T1547.001. The other options are unrelated to SSPs and boot-time execution.,
What is the primary purpose of the Registry key HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Security Packages?,To define system-wide security policies,To configure network connectivity settings,To store user account credentials,To specify Security Support Providers (SSPs) loaded at boot,D,The "Security Packages" key specifically lists SSPs used by the Local Security Authority (LSA) during system startup, not the other options.,
What is the name of the Windows API function used to add new Security Support Providers (SSPs) to the system?,CreateProcess,AddSecurityPackage,LoadLibraryEx,SetSecurityDescriptor,B,AddSecurityPackage is the designated API function for dynamically adding SSPs. The other options are related to different Windows functions.,
According to the provided text, which Windows versions are potentially vulnerable to the exploitation of unsigned SSP DLLs due to the absence of the Protected Process Light (PPL) feature?,Windows 10, Windows Server 2016, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008,D,Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 introduced PPL, making earlier versions more vulnerable to unsigned SSP DLLs.,
Which of these tools can be utilized to enumerate existing Security Support Providers (SSPs) on a Windows system?,PowerSploit's Install-SSP,Mimikatz,Empire,Cobalt Strike,C,Empire's capabilities include enumerating SSPs. The other options focus on different aspects like persistence (Install-SSP), credential dumping (Mimikatz), and post-exploitation (Cobalt Strike).,
Which MITRE ATT&CK technique does the use of PowerSploit's Install-SSP module to install a malicious SSP DLL fall under?,T1547.001, Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Security Support Provider, T1059.005, Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell, T1055.003, Process Discovery: Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), T1059.007, Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell,D,The use of PowerShell to install an SSP DLL directly aligns with the PowerShell command interpreter and T1059.007. The other options are not specific to PowerShell or SSP installation.,
What is a potential mitigation strategy against the exploitation of Security Support Providers (SSPs) in Windows versions prior to 8.1 and Server 2012 R2?,Enforcing multi-factor authentication,Disabling the Local Security Authority (LSA),Enabling Protected Process Light (PPL) for the LSA, Implementing intrusion detection systems,C,Enabling PPL for the LSA, while not directly applicable to older versions, is the most relevant mitigation as it prevents unsigned SSP DLLs from loading into the LSA. Other options are not specific to this threat vector.,
What is the purpose of setting the Registry key HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\LSASS.exe with AuditLevel = 8 in Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 R2?,To prevent unauthorized access to the LSA,To restrict the use of unsigned SSP DLLs,To limit the number of processes that can access the LSA, To enforce mandatory code signing for all system executables,B,Setting AuditLevel = 8 specifically targets the monitoring of unsigned SSP DLLs loading into the LSA, effectively restricting their use.,
Which of the following describes a potential detection method for the abuse of Security Support Providers (SSPs) in a Windows environment?,Monitoring for changes in the Local Security Authority (LSA) process memory, Monitoring the system for unusual network activity, Monitoring the execution of commands and arguments related to SSPs, Monitoring user account activity for suspicious login attempts,C,Monitoring commands and arguments related to SSPs directly addresses the execution of commands aimed at manipulating or exploiting SSPs, making it the most relevant detection method in this context.,
What is the primary function of the Mimikatz credential dumper's SSP implementation?,To provide secure password storage for system users,To monitor user login attempts for suspicious activity,To extract credentials from the Local Security Authority (LSA),To enforce stricter access control policies for sensitive data,C,Mimikatz's SSP implementation aims to extract credentials from the LSA, effectively leveraging its access to sensitive information for credential theft.,
