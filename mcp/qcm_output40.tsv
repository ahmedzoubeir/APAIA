Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is the primary purpose of a Login Hook on macOS?	To execute a script upon system startup,	To establish persistence and execute a script upon user logon,	To monitor user activity and report it to a remote server,	To modify system settings and bypass security controls,	B,	Login Hooks are designed to execute scripts with root privileges when a user logs in, providing a persistent mechanism for adversaries to maintain access.
What file contains the configuration for Login Hooks on macOS?	/etc/passwd,	/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist,	/var/log/auth.log,	/Library/LaunchAgents,	B,	The com.apple.loginwindow.plist file stores the configuration for Login Hooks, including the script to execute upon user logon.
Which of the following is NOT a mitigation strategy for Login Hook exploitation?	Restricting write access to logon scripts to specific administrators,	Monitoring for changes to login hook files,	Enabling full disk encryption on the system,	Monitoring for processes that install or modify login hooks,	C,	While full disk encryption provides overall system security, it doesn't directly address the specific vulnerability of Login Hooks.
What is the MITRE ATT&CK pattern ID and name for the technique of establishing persistence through Login Hooks?	T1037,	Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts,	T1547.002,	Persistence - Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts,	B,	Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts is the ATT&CK pattern for techniques that use boot or logon processes for persistence.
Which macOS version deprecated Login Hooks in favor of alternative persistence mechanisms?	10.9 Mavericks,	10.10 Yosemite,	10.11 El Capitan,	10.12 Sierra,	C,	macOS 10.11 El Capitan deprecated Login Hooks, recommending Launch Daemons and Launch Agents for persistence.
What is the maximum number of Login Hooks and Logout Hooks that can be active on a macOS system at a time?	One,	Two,	Three,	Four,	A,	Only one Login Hook and one Logout Hook can be active on a system at a time, meaning an adversary can only use one hook for each event.
Which of the following is NOT a valid method for detecting the presence or modification of Login Hooks?	Monitoring for changes in the /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist file,	Analyzing system logs for suspicious processes or commands,	Inspecting the /etc/shadow file for unauthorized user accounts,	Monitoring for processes spawned by Login Hooks,	C,	The /etc/shadow file contains encrypted password hashes and is not directly related to Login Hook detection.
What is the most effective approach to mitigate Login Hook exploitation on macOS?	Disabling the Login Hook feature completely,	Applying a security patch to address the vulnerability,	Monitoring for suspicious activity and blocking malicious processes,	Implementing a robust security policy that restricts access to critical system files,	D,	Restricting access to system files and directories related to Login Hooks, combined with monitoring, is a comprehensive approach to mitigate this threat.
If an adversary successfully installs a Login Hook, what is the most likely outcome?	System performance degradation,	Data leakage,	Denial of service,	Remote code execution,	D,	Login Hooks allow execution of scripts with root privileges, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise.
What is the primary security concern associated with Login Hooks in macOS?	The possibility of attackers bypassing user authentication and gaining access to the system with root privileges,	The potential for attackers to compromise the integrity of system files,	The risk of attackers installing malicious software on the system,	The potential for attackers to launch denial-of-service attacks against the system,	A,	Login Hooks allow attackers to execute code with root privileges, bypassing user authentication and granting them high-level system control.
