Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is the purpose of the Event Monitor Daemon (emond) on macOS?  ,To monitor and control system processes.,To manage user accounts and permissions.,To execute scripts and commands based on predefined events.,To handle network traffic and security policies.,C,Emond is designed to execute scripts and commands based on predefined events, such as system startup or user authentication.,
Which MITRE ATT&CK technique does the emond service exploit for persistence and privilege escalation?  ,TA0002 - Execution,TA0005 - Data Staged,TA0006 -  Execution/Command and Scripting Interpreter,TA0007 -  Persistence.,C,The use of emond to execute malicious content triggered by predefined events aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique "Execution/Command and Scripting Interpreter (TA0006)" which describes the use of various methods to execute commands and scripts.,
Which of the following is NOT a valid event type that can trigger an emond rule?  ,System startup.,User authentication.,File modification.,Network connection.,D,Emond rules are triggered by events like system startup, user authentication, and potentially file modification. Network connection events are not typically associated with emond triggers.,
Which of these directories holds the configuration files for emond rules?  ,/etc/emond.d/rules/,/private/var/db/emondClients/,/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/,All of the above.,D,Emond rules are defined in files within the /etc/emond.d/rules/ directory, and the Launch Daemon configuration file at /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.emond.plist contains settings related to the emond service, including the path to the emondClients directory for event queuing.,
How can an attacker escalate privileges using emond?  ,By creating a rule that grants administrator permissions to a specific user.,By modifying the emond service to run with higher privileges.,By using emond to execute a script that exploits a system vulnerability.,By exploiting a vulnerability in the emond process itself.,C,Attackers can use emond to execute malicious scripts or commands that exploit vulnerabilities in the system, potentially leading to privilege escalation.,
Which of the following is NOT a recommended detection strategy for emond-related threats?  ,Monitoring changes to the emond rules files.,Monitoring process execution history for suspicious processes.,Monitoring network traffic for unusual activity related to emond.,Monitoring user login events for potential privilege escalation attempts.,C,While monitoring network traffic for suspicious activity is generally important, it's not directly linked to emond-related threats. The focus is on identifying changes in emond configuration or execution activity.,
What is a recommended mitigation strategy for emond-related threats?  ,Disable emond by removing the Launch Daemon plist file.,Enable stricter access control for emond rules files.,Regularly audit emond rules for suspicious entries.,All of the above.,D,Disabling emond removes the potential for exploitation, stricter access control prevents unauthorized rule modification, and regular audits help detect suspicious rule entries. All these measures contribute to mitigating emond-related threats.,
What type of format are emond rule files stored in?  ,JSON.,XML.,YAML.,Property List (plist).,D,Emond rule files are stored in the Property List (plist) format, a commonly used format for storing configuration data on macOS.,
Which of these actions is most likely to be considered suspicious related to emond?  ,A user logging in to the system.,A process being created by the system.,A new emond rule file being created in /etc/emond.d/rules/.,A user accessing a file in a specific directory.,C,Creating a new emond rule file in the designated directory is a strong indicator of potential manipulation or exploitation of the emond service, raising suspicion.,
What is a recommended defensive strategy against emond-related threats?  ,Implement strong password policies.,Enable two-factor authentication for user accounts.,Use a security information and event management (SIEM) system.,Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.,D,Endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions are particularly useful for detecting and responding to threats related to emond, as they can monitor processes, file changes, and network activity to identify suspicious behavior associated with the emond service.,
