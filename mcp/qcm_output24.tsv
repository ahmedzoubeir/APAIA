This is achieved by placing a reference to a binary in the registry key HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\ with the key value "Authentication Packages"=<target binary>.,The provided text focuses on registry manipulation for persistence, not exploiting vulnerabilities in authentication package DLLs.,The text does not mention modifying the LSA process to directly load the malicious DLL.,The text focuses on registry manipulation for persistence, not exploiting vulnerabilities in authentication package DLLs.
What is the name of the MITRE ATT&CK technique described in the text?,Boot or Logon Autostart Execution,Authentication Package,Windows Authentication Package,LSA Authentication Package Abuse,A,The text explicitly states "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution" as the technique.,The text mentions "Authentication Package" as a sub-technique but not the main technique.,The text discusses "Windows Authentication Package" as a component within the system, not a technique itself.,The text refers to "LSA Authentication Package Abuse" as a tactic, but not the primary technique.,The text details the use of authentication packages for persistence, falling under the category of "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution."
Which registry key is used by adversaries to place a reference to a binary for persistence, according to the text?,HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\LSASS.exe,HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Authentication Packages,HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\RunAsPPL,HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa,B,The text explicitly mentions the registry key HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\ with the key value "Authentication Packages"=<target binary> for persistence.,This registry key is used for auditing LSA process, not persistence.,This key is used for configuring LSA as Protected Process Light (PPL), not persistence.,While this key is part of the LSA configuration, the specific key for persistence is mentioned in the text.,The provided text describes the use of HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\ with the key value "Authentication Packages"=<target binary> for persistence.
Which of the following is a mitigation strategy against adversaries using authentication packages for persistence, based on the text?,Enabling LSA Protected Process Light (PPL) mode.,Monitoring for changes in the HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\ registry key.,Using antivirus software to scan for malicious DLLs.,Disabling the LSA authentication package functionality.,A,The text mentions that setting the registry key HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\RunAsPPL enables LSA Protected Process Light (PPL) mode, which requires all DLLs loaded by LSA to be signed by Microsoft.,While monitoring registry changes is a detection method, it is not a mitigation strategy.,Antivirus software is a general security measure, not specifically targeted at this technique.,Disabling LSA authentication package functionality would hinder legitimate system operations.,The text specifically highlights enabling LSA Protected Process Light (PPL) mode as a mitigation strategy against this technique.
Which of the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques is directly related to the described approach of abusing authentication packages for persistence? (Enterprise Platform),T1547.001: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder,T1543.001:  Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Event Subscription,T1547.002: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Scheduled Task,T1546.003:  Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: User-Defined Login Script,A,The described approach of abusing authentication packages aligns with the "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder" technique as it leverages the registry to ensure persistence.,This technique focuses on using WMI events for persistence, not registry manipulation for authentication packages.,This technique focuses on scheduled tasks for persistence, not registry manipulation for authentication packages.,This technique involves using user-defined login scripts for persistence, not registry manipulation for authentication packages.,The text describes the technique of using the registry to ensure persistence upon boot, which falls under the "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder" technique.
Which of the following is NOT a detection method for adversaries abusing authentication packages for persistence, as mentioned in the text?,Monitoring the LSA process for DLL loads,Monitoring the registry for changes to the LSA registry keys,Monitoring executed commands and arguments that may abuse authentication packages,Scanning for malicious DLLs loaded into the LSA process.,D,The text mentions monitoring the LSA process for DLL loads, monitoring registry changes for LSA keys, and monitoring executed commands and arguments as detection methods.,While scanning for malicious DLLs is a general security practice, the text doesn't explicitly mention this as a detection method for this specific technique.,The text outlines monitoring the LSA process, registry changes, and executed commands as detection methods for this technique.,The text does not mention scanning for malicious DLLs as a detection method specifically related to this technique.
Which of the following events can be monitored to detect potential malicious DLL loads into the LSA, according to the text?,Windows events generated when unsigned DLLs attempt to load into LSA.,Windows events generated when the LSA process is terminated.,Windows events generated when the registry key HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\ is modified.,Windows events generated when a new authentication package is registered.,A,The text mentions that setting the Registry key HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\LSASS.exe with AuditLevel = 8 can generate events when unsigned DLLs attempt to load into LSA.,These events are related to LSA process termination, not specifically to DLL loads.,These events are related to LSA configuration changes, not specifically to DLL loads.,These events are related to registration of authentication packages, not specifically to DLL loads.,The text states that Windows can generate events when unsigned DLLs attempt to load into LSA, which can be monitored for detection.
According to the text, what operating systems have the potential to mitigate this attack by running LSA as a Protected Process Light (PPL)? (Select all that apply),Windows 7,Windows 8.1,Windows Server 2012,Windows Server 2012 R2,B,D,The text mentions that Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, and later versions can run LSA as a PPL.,Windows 7 does not have this feature, according to the text.,Windows Server 2012 does not have this feature, according to the text.,The text explicitly states that Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2, and later versions can enable LSA Protected Process Light (PPL).
Which of the following is NOT a consequence of adversaries successfully using the described technique to execute a DLL at boot time?,The malicious DLL could potentially intercept sensitive data exchanged by the LSA process.,The malicious DLL could potentially modify system settings and configurations.,The malicious DLL could potentially establish a backdoor into the system.,The malicious DLL could potentially access and modify user files on the system.,D,The text suggests that a malicious DLL executed at boot time could potentially intercept sensitive data, modify system settings, and establish a backdoor.,While the malicious DLL might have access to the system, the text doesn't explicitly mention modifying user files as a primary consequence.,The text describes the potential for intercepting sensitive data, modifying system settings, and establishing a backdoor. The text does not explicitly mention user file modification as a primary consequence.
What is the name of the malware mentioned in the text as an example of using Windows Authentication Packages for persistence?,Flame,Stuxnet,Duqu,Gauss,A,The text explicitly mentions "Flame" as an example of malware using Windows Authentication Packages for persistence.,The text does not mention Stuxnet as an example.,The text does not mention Duqu as an example.,The text does not mention Gauss as an example.,The text provides "Flame" as an example of malware leveraging Windows Authentication Packages for persistence.
