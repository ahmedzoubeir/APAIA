What is the purpose of the tty_tickets variable in the sudo configuration?,To enforce a password prompt for every sudo command execution,To prevent password caching across different terminal sessions,To limit the number of concurrent sudo sessions,To disable sudo functionality entirely,B,The tty_tickets variable isolates sudo timeout settings per terminal session, preventing credential reuse across different terminals.,
Which of the following is NOT a mitigation strategy for the abuse of sudo and sudo caching?,Enabling tty_tickets,Setting timestamp_timeout to 0,Disabling logging of sudo commands,Strictly editing the sudoers file,C,Disabling logging of sudo commands would hinder detection and investigation efforts. All other options are valid mitigation strategies.,
What is the significance of the /var/db/sudo timestamp in the context of sudo caching?,It indicates the last time the system was booted,It stores the user's password for sudo commands,It represents the time elapsed since the last successful sudo execution,It determines the interval for password prompt re-appearance,C,The /var/db/sudo timestamp is used to determine if the sudo password prompt should be re-displayed based on the timestamp_timeout setting.,
Which of the following malware families is mentioned in the text as exploiting the sudoers file to achieve privilege escalation?,Cobalt Strike,Dok,Proton,All of the above,D,The text explicitly mentions that Cobalt Strike, Dok, and Proton all utilize or modify the sudoers file for privilege escalation purposes.,

What is the impact of disabling tty_tickets on sudo functionality?,It forces password prompts for every sudo command execution,It eliminates the need for a password for sudo commands,It allows sudo commands to be executed from any terminal without password prompt,It prevents sudo commands from being executed,C,Disabling tty_tickets enables sudo command execution from any terminal session without re-prompting for a password.,
What is a key difference between sudo and sudoers?,Sudo is a command, while sudoers is a configuration file,Sudo allows privilege escalation, while sudoers does not,Sudo operates on macOS, while sudoers operates on Linux,Sudo is a vulnerability, while sudoers is a mitigation,A,Sudo is the command used to execute commands with elevated privileges, while sudoers is the configuration file that defines user permissions and rules for sudo.,
Which of the following detection methods could be used to identify the potential abuse of sudo and sudo caching?,Monitoring executed commands with sudo,Analyzing system logs for changes to sudo configuration files,Monitoring process creation events for elevated privileges,All of the above,D,All mentioned options are effective detection methods for identifying potential abuse of sudo and sudo caching.,
In the context of the sudoers file, what does NOPASSWD: ALL signify?,It grants unrestricted access to all commands without password prompt,It sets a password timeout for sudo commands,It limits sudo functionality to specific commands,It requires a password for every sudo command,A,The NOPASSWD: ALL directive in the sudoers file allows users to execute all commands without requiring a password prompt.,
