Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What MITRE ATT&CK technique ID and name does the text describe?,T1070.001, T1070.004, T1070.002, T1070.003,C,The text describes the "Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder" sub-technique of the "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution" (T1070) technique.,T1070.002 describes "Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder", which is the specific sub-technique discussed in the text.
What Registry key can be used to achieve persistence on Windows Vista and newer systems?,HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce,HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce,HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx,HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx,C,The text explicitly mentions that the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx key is not created by default on Windows Vista and newer. The other options are valid Registry keys used for persistence, but they are not specifically mentioned in the text as not being created by default on Windows Vista and newer.
What is the default value for the BootExecute registry key, according to the text?,autocheck autochk,autocheck autochk *,autocheck autoche,autocheck autochk **,B,The text states the default value is "autocheck autochk *", which is used to automatically check the file-system integrity at startup.,The default value of "autocheck autochk *" is used to perform automatic file-system integrity checks during startup. This is different from the "autocheck autochk" or "autocheck autoche" values that are used to potentially execute malicious payloads.
What is the path to the system-wide startup folder on a Windows system, according to the text?,C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp,C:\Users\Public\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp,C:\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp,C:\Windows\system32\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp,A,The text explicitly states that the system-wide startup folder path is "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp".,The text explicitly provides the path to the system-wide startup folder, which is used to automatically execute programs for all users.
Which of the following malware families has NOT been known to use Registry run keys for persistence?,APT32,APT33,APT39,APT41,D,While APT41 has been known to modify startup files for persistence, the text mentions they specifically used a Registry key under HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Svchost to establish persistence for Cobalt Strike, not HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run.,APT32, APT33, and APT39 are all specifically listed in the text as using Registry run keys for persistence.
Which of the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques is most closely related to the detection of "Registry modifications are often essential in establishing persistence via known Windows mechanisms."?,T1027, T1059.005, T1070, T1106,A,The text mentions that "Registry modifications are often essential in establishing persistence", which directly aligns with the T1027 technique, "Command and Scripting Interpreter". This technique describes the use of command-line interpreters and scripting languages for execution, often involving registry modifications.,While the other techniques might be involved in some scenarios, T1027, "Command and Scripting Interpreter", is the most relevant and direct to the statement in the text.
What is the purpose of the provided "Analytic 1 - Reg.exe called from Command Shell" detection rule?,To identify suspicious executions of reg.exe from a command shell that might be related to persistence,To detect legitimate executions of reg.exe from a command shell,To identify instances of reg.exe being used to modify the Registry,To identify instances of reg.exe being used for malicious purposes,A,The provided detection rule is designed to focus on identifying suspicious executions of reg.exe from a command shell, potentially indicating malicious activity related to persistence.,The detection rule specifically targets reg.exe execution from cmd.exe, which is often associated with modifying the Registry for persistence purposes. It aims to differentiate between legitimate and potentially malicious usage.
What is the most effective mitigation technique against Registry run key persistence, according to the text?,Implement strong authentication measures,Utilize antivirus software with behavioral analysis capabilities,Regularly scan for and remove malware,Monitor and analyze system activity for suspicious Registry changes,D,The text explicitly states that "This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features." This implies that mitigation primarily relies on detection and response mechanisms.,While the other options may provide some level of protection, the most effective mitigation against Registry run key persistence is actively monitoring and analyzing system activity for suspicious Registry changes, which allows for timely detection and remediation.
What is the recommended approach for monitoring Registry run key changes?,Use a combination of tools such as Sysinternals Autoruns and Windows EID 9707,Monitor for changes to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run key,Utilize a security information and event management (SIEM) system to correlate relevant events,Use a dedicated registry monitoring tool to track all changes to Registry run keys,A,The text suggests using both Sysinternals Autoruns and Windows EID 9707 to monitor Registry run keys.,The provided text recommends a combined approach, incorporating tools like Sysinternals Autoruns and Windows EID 9707 to effectively monitor and identify suspicious Registry changes.
What is the purpose of the "Analytic 1 - Modification of Default Startup Folder in the Registry Key ‘Common Startup’" detection rule?,To identify any modifications to the "Common Startup" folder,To detect suspicious changes to the Startup folder,To identify changes to the Startup folder that may be indicative of malicious activity,To track all changes to the "Common Startup" folder,C,The rule aims to identify changes to the "Common Startup" folder that could be indicative of malicious activity by attackers attempting to evade detection.,The detection rule specifically focuses on changes to the "Common Startup" folder in the Registry, which is often manipulated by attackers to hide malicious files. It aims to flag these changes for further investigation.
