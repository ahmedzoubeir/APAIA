Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is the main purpose of AppInit DLLs in Windows?,To load system libraries at startup.,To provide persistence for legitimate applications.,To load malicious DLLs into every process.,To manage user account permissions.,B,AppInit DLLs are designed to load legitimate system libraries at startup, not malicious DLLs. They're a system feature, not a security mechanism.
Which of these Windows versions is NOT vulnerable to exploitation of the AppInit DLL functionality?,Windows 7,Windows 10,Windows XP,Windows 8,D,Windows 8 and later versions with secure boot enabled are not vulnerable to AppInit DLL exploitation.
Which MITRE ATT&CK technique does the exploitation of AppInit DLLs fall under?,Persistence (T1011),Privilege Escalation (T1068),Defense Evasion (T1078),All of the above,D,Exploiting AppInit DLLs can be used for persistence, privilege escalation, and defense evasion, so all of the above are correct.
Which of the following is NOT a recommended mitigation strategy against AppInit DLL exploitation?,Application control tools,Disabling secure boot on Windows 8+,Monitoring for unusual DLL loads,Enabling Windows Defender Application Control,B,Disabling secure boot on Windows 8+ would actually increase the vulnerability, as this feature is designed to protect against such attacks.
Which of the following Registry keys is NOT associated with AppInit DLLs?,HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows,HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows,HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services,HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options,C,The Registry keys associated with AppInit DLLs are HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services is used for managing system services.
What is the purpose of the “LoadAppInit_DLLs” Registry value?,It determines if the user32.dll is loaded.,It enables or disables the AppInit DLL functionality.,It specifies the directory where AppInit DLLs are stored.,It controls the order in which AppInit DLLs are loaded.,B,The "LoadAppInit_DLLs" Registry value enables or disables the AppInit DLL functionality. A value of 0x1 enables it, while a value of 0x0 disables it.
What is the main advantage of using application control tools to mitigate AppInit DLL exploitation?,They can monitor and analyze suspicious DLL loads.,They can block the execution of unauthorized DLLs.,They can detect modifications to the AppInit_DLLs Registry keys.,They can prevent attackers from installing new AppInit DLLs.,B,Application control tools like Windows Defender Application Control, AppLocker, and Software Restriction Policies can block the execution of unauthorized DLLs, preventing malicious code from being loaded via AppInit DLLs.
Which of the following is NOT a common indicator of AppInit DLL exploitation?,Modified Registry keys,New processes created,Unusually high CPU usage,Newly loaded DLLs,C,While high CPU usage can be indicative of various attacks, it's not specifically linked to AppInit DLL exploitation. The other options are directly associated with this attack method.
What is the purpose of the Sysmon Event ID 1 and Windows Security Log Event ID 4688 in detecting AppInit DLL exploitation?,To monitor changes to the AppInit DLLs Registry keys.,To detect new process creations.,To track DLL loads by user32.dll.,To identify suspicious API calls,A,Sysmon Event ID 1 and Windows Security Log Event ID 4688 are primarily used to monitor changes to the AppInit DLLs Registry keys, which are potential indicators of AppInit DLL exploitation.
What is the main purpose of the “Analytic 1 - AppInit DLLs” provided in the document?,To identify malicious DLLs being loaded through AppInit DLLs.,To monitor changes to the AppInit DLLs Registry keys.,To detect unusual API calls related to AppInit DLLs.,To prevent the execution of unauthorized DLLs.,B,The "Analytic 1 - AppInit DLLs" provided is a detection rule designed to monitor changes to the AppInit DLLs Registry keys. It aims to identify any unauthorized modifications that could indicate malicious activity.
