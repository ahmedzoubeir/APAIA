Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What MITRE ATT&CK technique ID corresponds to the "Change Default File Association" sub-technique?,T1126,T1547,T1543,T1120,A,This technique is classified under the Persistence tactic and is represented by the ID T1126 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
What is the primary mechanism used by adversaries to modify default file associations in Windows systems?,Exploiting vulnerabilities in file handling libraries,Modifying registry entries related to file extensions,Using specialized tools like "assoc" for manipulating associations,Injecting malicious code into legitimate applications that handle file associations,B,Adversaries typically modify file associations by directly editing registry entries related to specific file extensions. 
How are system file associations primarily organized within the Windows Registry?,Under the [HKEY_CURRENT_USER] key,Under the [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE] key,Under the [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT] key,Under the [HKEY_USERS] key,C,System file associations are predominantly stored and managed under the [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT] key in the Windows Registry. 
Which of the following is NOT a valid mitigation strategy for the "Change Default File Association" sub-technique?,Educating users on the risks of opening unknown file types,Implement application whitelisting policies to restrict executable files,Regularly audit and monitor registry changes related to file associations,Employing network intrusion detection systems to identify malicious traffic associated with file downloads,D,While network intrusion detection systems can help detect malicious downloads, they are not directly effective in mitigating the "Change Default File Association" sub-technique, which focuses on registry manipulations.
What is the primary benefit of monitoring changes to the [HKEY_CURRENT_USER]\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts registry key for threat detection?,Detecting changes to user preferences for default file associations,Identifying malicious programs attempting to modify the system's default file associations,Monitoring attempts to create new user accounts with elevated privileges,Detecting unauthorized modifications to the system's network configuration,A,Monitoring changes to the [HKEY_CURRENT_USER]\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts registry key focuses on identifying changes to user preferences for default file associations. 
Which of the following is a commonly used tool for managing and modifying file associations on Windows systems?,The "net" command,The "assoc" utility,The "regedit" editor,The "taskmgr" utility,B,The "assoc" utility is a built-in command-line tool in Windows that allows administrators to manage and modify file associations.
Which of the following is NOT a reliable detection method for the "Change Default File Association" sub-technique?,Monitoring executed commands and arguments,Analyzing changes in user-defined file associations,Monitoring newly executed processes for unusual behavior,Implementing antivirus software for real-time file scanning,D,While antivirus software is important for overall security, it may not always effectively detect changes to file associations, which are typically legitimate registry manipulations.
What is the primary goal of an adversary attempting to exploit the "Change Default File Association" sub-technique?,Gaining persistence on the compromised system,Performing lateral movement across the network,Evading detection by security tools,Escalating privileges to gain administrator access,A,The primary objective of exploiting the "Change Default File Association" technique is to establish persistence on the system by ensuring malicious content is executed when a specific file type is opened.
Which of the following is the most effective way to prevent the "Change Default File Association" sub-technique from being exploited?,Disable user account control (UAC) to allow unrestricted registry modifications,Employ a strong password policy for all user accounts,Implement application whitelisting to restrict executable files,Disable the "assoc" utility to prevent modifications to file associations,C,Implementing application whitelisting policies, which restrict the execution of unauthorized applications, is the most effective way to prevent the exploitation of the "Change Default File Association" sub-technique as it limits the ability of malicious programs to modify file associations.
What is the most appropriate technique for detecting the "Change Default File Association" sub-technique on a Windows Enterprise environment?,Analyzing user login attempts for unusual patterns,Monitoring network traffic for suspicious connections,Correlating changes in registry entries with process execution,Analyzing logs for system performance degradation,C,Correlating changes in registry entries, specifically those related to file associations, with process execution is the most effective technique for detecting the "Change Default File Association" sub-technique in an Enterprise environment.
