Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What technique ID does the MITRE ATT&CK framework use for establishing persistence through boot or logon initialization scripts?,T1037.001,T1037.002,T1037.004,T1037.005,C,T1037.005 refers to the sub-technique of using boot or logon initialization scripts to establish persistence.,
Which of these is NOT a mitigation strategy for defending against adversaries using boot or logon initialization scripts to establish persistence?,Restrict write access to logon scripts to specific administrators,Ensure proper permissions are set for Registry hives to prevent users from modifying keys for logon scripts that may lead to persistence,Monitor for changes made in the Active Directory that may use scripts automatically executed at boot or logon initialization to establish persistence,Monitor for newly constructed windows registry keys that may use scripts automatically executed at boot or logon initialization to establish persistence.,C,Monitoring changes in Active Directory focuses on detecting suspicious activity, not directly mitigating the risk.,
Which of the following is a reliable indicator that an adversary may be using boot or logon initialization scripts to establish persistence?,A user logging in at an unusual time,A new file being created in the /etc/init/ folder,An executable file being launched from the Windows Startup folder,A registry key edit under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\EnvironmentUserInitMprLogonScript,D,The registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\EnvironmentUserInitMprLogonScript is directly associated with scheduling scripts to run at login, making it a strong indicator of potential adversary activity.,
Which of these techniques is NOT specifically mentioned in the provided text as a method used by adversaries to establish persistence through boot or logon initialization scripts?,Using a .conf file in the /etc/init/ folder for persistence,Hijacking legitimate application-specific startup scripts,Installing an "init.d" startup script,Using a scheduled task to execute a malicious script,D,While scheduled tasks can be used for malicious purposes, the text focuses on the specific technique of leveraging boot or logon initialization scripts, not generic scheduling methods.,
Which of the following is a key reason why adversaries might use boot or logon initialization scripts to establish persistence?,To gain administrator privileges on the system,To avoid detection by security monitoring tools,To facilitate the execution of malware on system startup,To perform network reconnaissance on the targeted system,C,Boot or logon initialization scripts allow malware to execute automatically when the system starts, ensuring persistent access for the adversary.,
What is the primary focus of the "Analytic 1 - Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts" section provided in the text?,Monitoring for suspicious commands being executed,Analyzing the contents of logon scripts for malicious activity,Detecting potential modifications to the registry related to boot or logon initialization scripts,Monitoring for unusual user accounts accessing logon scripts,C,The analytic focuses on specific Windows event log entries related to registry modifications in the context of logon initialization scripts, indicating potential malicious activity.,
In a typical enterprise environment, which of the following could be used to detect potential misuse of boot or logon initialization scripts for malicious purposes?,Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS),Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems,Firewall logs,Antivirus software,B,SIEM systems are specifically designed to correlate and analyze security events from various sources, including those related to registry changes and process executions, making them ideal for detecting misuse of boot or logon initialization scripts.,
What is the primary benefit of using a "Windows Sysinternals Autoruns" tool when investigating potential misuse of boot or logon initialization scripts?,It can identify and analyze the contents of logon scripts for malicious code,It can detect and report any changes made to the logon scripts,It can automatically block any attempts to modify logon scripts,It can identify and visualize the relationships between different processes and startup items,D,Autoruns provides a comprehensive view of startup items, including those associated with boot or logon initialization scripts, aiding in the identification of potential malicious activity by visualizing process relationships.,
Which of the following would be considered a false positive when monitoring for changes made to the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\EnvironmentUserInitMprLogonScript registry key?,A user adding a benign script to the key,A system administrator updating a logon script with administrative privileges,A malware program creating a new key under the specified path,A script being executed at startup without any modifications to the registry key,A,The text specifically mentions that benign user-added scripts can trigger false positives, while the other options represent legitimate administrative actions or potential malicious activity.,
Which of these best describes the relationship between the "Windows Sysinternals Autoruns" tool and the provided "Analytic 1 - Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts"?,The Autoruns tool provides a more detailed analysis of registry modifications compared to the Analytic 1,The Analytic 1 provides a more focused analysis of specific event logs related to logon script modifications,The Autoruns tool is a more effective method for detecting malicious activity related to logon scripts than the Analytic 1,The Autoruns tool and the Analytic 1 cover the same aspects of logon script analysis with different approaches,B,The Analytic 1 specifically targets specific event log entries related to registry modifications, while Autoruns provides a broader view of startup items, offering different but complementary analysis approaches.
