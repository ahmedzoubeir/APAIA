Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is the most suitable MITRE ATT&CK pattern technique for detecting an adversary using CreateServiceW() API to load a malicious driver for persistence?,T1057.001 -  Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service,T1055.001 -  Process Injection: Dynamic-Link Library Injection,T1059.001 -  Command and Control: Non-Standard Port,T1069.001 -  Execution: Command Line,A,The CreateServiceW() API is specifically used to create or modify Windows services, making T1057.001 the most relevant technique for detecting such activities.
How does the adversary typically make detection of malicious services more difficult?,By using a service name that is related to a legitimate operating system component,By installing the malicious service without modifying the Windows Registry,By using a service name that is too generic, like "Service1",By encrypting the service executable with a strong encryption algorithm,A,The text mentions using "Masquerade Task or Service" as a technique, indicating the adversary would choose a service name mimicking a legitimate one to avoid detection.
In an enterprise environment, which of the following is a recommended mitigation strategy against adversaries exploiting Windows services?,Implementing multi-factor authentication for all service accounts,Disabling all Windows services except those deemed absolutely essential,Configuring Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to monitor for suspicious network traffic associated with service modifications,Employing a strong password policy for all user accounts,C, While all options contribute to security, the most direct mitigation against service abuse is to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity related to service modifications, which is the primary role of an IDS.
What is the primary reason why adversaries might use a service to escalate privileges?,Services are inherently run with administrator privileges,Services can be modified to directly access sensitive user data,Services are designed to be executed with SYSTEM privileges,Services allow attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms,C, Services are executed under SYSTEM privileges, which grants them high-level access, making them attractive for privilege escalation by adversaries.
Which of the following events should be monitored to detect the creation of a new service with an unusual directory path?,Event ID 4697 and 7045,Event ID 6 and 12,Event ID 13 and 14,Event ID 4688 and 4697,A,Event IDs 4697 and 7045 are specifically related to the creation of new services, making them suitable for detecting suspicious service creation attempts with unusual directory paths.
What type of analytic can be used to identify a potential malicious service launch using cmd.exe, based on the text provided?,Searching for processes named "cmd.exe" with a parent process of "services.exe",Monitoring for events where cmd.exe is launched with the "/c" flag,Identifying instances of cmd.exe executing commands with system privileges,Analyzing the command-line arguments of services.exe for suspicious commands,A, The text recommends monitoring for processes named "cmd.exe" with a parent process of "services.exe" as a way to detect potential malicious service launches, as this scenario should not occur normally.
How does Driver Signature Enforcement mitigate the risk of malicious driver installation?,By preventing the installation of any unsigned driver,By verifying the digital signature of a driver before installation,By requiring administrator privileges for driver installation,By blocking all third-party driver installations,B, Driver Signature Enforcement primarily mitigates the risk by verifying the digital signature of a driver before installation, ensuring that it comes from a trusted source.
What is the recommended approach for monitoring service driver installations?,Focusing on drivers signed by Microsoft and ignoring others,Filtering and excluding driver load events signed by known legitimate publishers,Monitoring all driver load events, regardless of the signature,Prioritizing drivers installed during known software update cycles,B, Filtering and excluding driver load events signed by known legitimate publishers helps reduce alert volume and false positives, allowing for more efficient detection of suspicious driver installations.
What is a key characteristic of a legitimate Windows service?,It runs under the SYSTEM user account,It has a predefined entry point named "SvcMain",It is always automatically started at system boot,It is installed in the "C:\Windows\System32" directory,B, Legitimate Windows services have a specific entry point called "SvcMain", which is crucial for their proper execution and recognition.
Which of the following is a technique that adversaries use to evade detection when modifying services?,Using the "sc.exe" command to modify services,Creating new services with a random name,Changing the service startup type to "automatic",Using a service name that mimics a legitimate OS component,D, Mimicking legitimate OS components through service names is a common technique for adversaries to evade detection, as it blends in with legitimate services.
