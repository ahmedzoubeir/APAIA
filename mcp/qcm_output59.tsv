Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is the primary purpose of the LC_LOAD_DYLIB header in a Mach-O binary?,Specifying the program's entry point.,Loading dynamic libraries at runtime.,Managing memory allocation for the binary.,Defining the binary's architecture.,B,The LC_LOAD_DYLIB header instructs the operating system to load specific dynamic libraries (dylibs) during the execution of the binary.,
What is a potential mitigation for the use of LC_LOAD_DYLIB to load malicious dylibs?,Enforce strong password policies for user accounts.,Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.,Verify the digital signatures of all downloaded binaries.,Baseline the required dynamic libraries for each application.,D,Baselining the required dynamic libraries for each application helps detect when an unexpected library is loaded, potentially indicating malicious activity.,
Which of the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques is most closely related to the exploitation of LC_LOAD_DYLIB?,T1055 - Process Injection.,T1127 - Modify Registry.,T1546.003 - Dynamic-Link Library Injection.,T1566.001 - Software Packing.,C,T1546.003 - Dynamic-Link Library Injection accurately describes the technique of loading malicious dylibs into a legitimate process using the LC_LOAD_DYLIB header.,
What is a key defensive measure against the modification of Mach-O binary headers?,Implementing a strong firewall to block unauthorized access to the system.,Enforcing code signing using valid Apple Developer IDs.,Disabling the use of dynamic libraries in the operating system.,Regularly scanning for malware using antivirus software.,B,Enforcing code signing with valid Apple Developer IDs ensures that modifications to binary headers are detected and prevented, as any alteration would invalidate the signature.,
Which of the following is NOT a recommended detection technique for malicious activity related to LC_LOAD_DYLIB exploitation?,Monitoring file system changes to application binaries.,Analyzing network traffic for unusual connections.,Monitoring the creation and loading of DLL/PE files.,Checking for changes to binary checksums/signatures.,B,While network traffic analysis is important for overall security, it is not directly related to the specific technique of modifying binary headers for malicious purposes.,
What is a potential indicator of a compromised system related to LC_LOAD_DYLIB exploitation?,Presence of unexpected files in the system's temporary directory.,Excessive CPU usage during system startup.,Unusual process termination events.,Loading of unknown or unexpected dynamic libraries.,E,Loading of unknown or unexpected dynamic libraries, particularly those not part of the application's baseline, is a clear indication of potential malicious activity related to LC_LOAD_DYLIB exploitation.,
Which of the following describes a defensive measure that can help prevent the exploitation of LC_LOAD_DYLIB?,Allowing applications only through known hashes.,Disabling the execution of dynamic libraries.,Implementing a strong firewall to block incoming connections.,Enforcing the use of sandboxed environments.,A,Allowing applications only through known hashes effectively prevents the loading of malicious dylibs by ensuring that only trusted binaries are executed.,
In the context of Enterprise environments, what is a crucial element of a defense-in-depth strategy against LC_LOAD_DYLIB exploitation?,Regularly updating system software and applications.,Using a network intrusion detection system (IDS).,Enforcing strong password policies for user accounts.,Implementing a comprehensive data loss prevention (DLP) system.,A,Regularly updating system software and applications ensures that any vulnerabilities related to LC_LOAD_DYLIB exploitation are patched, reducing the risk of compromise.,
What is a key consideration when investigating a potential compromise involving the modification of LC_LOAD_DYLIB headers?,The timing of the modification relative to application updates or patches.,The specific version of the affected application.,The type of network connection used to access the system.,The geographic location of the suspected attacker.,A,The timing of the modification relative to application updates or patches is crucial as it helps determine if the change was part of a legitimate update or a malicious exploit.,
Which of the following is an effective method for detecting potentially malicious changes to Mach-O binary headers?,Monitoring file system events for changes to application binaries.,Analyzing network traffic for suspicious activity.,Monitoring user login attempts for unusual patterns.,Implementing a data loss prevention (DLP) system.,A,Monitoring file system events for changes to application binaries helps detect modifications to binary headers, including those related to LC_LOAD_DYLIB exploitation.,
