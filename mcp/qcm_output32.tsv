Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is the primary service that loads the adversary-supplied DLL during system boot when using the Port Monitors sub-technique of Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (T1547.004) on Windows?,spoolsv.exe,svchost.exe,lsass.exe,explorer.exe,A,The text states that the adversary-supplied DLL is loaded by the print spooler service, spoolsv.exe.
What registry key is targeted by adversaries when using the Port Monitors sub-technique of Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (T1547.004) on Windows?,HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors,HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run,HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run,HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management,A,The text clearly states that the registry key targeted is HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors.
What is the name of the API call that adversaries use to set a DLL to be loaded at startup when using the Port Monitors sub-technique of Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (T1547.004) on Windows?,AddMonitor,LoadLibraryEx,CreateProcess,VirtualAllocEx,A,The text explicitly mentions using the AddMonitor API call to set the DLL to be loaded at startup.
Which of the following is NOT a recommended detection method for the Port Monitors sub-technique of Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (T1547.004) on Windows?,Monitoring process API calls to AddMonitor,Monitoring DLLs loaded by spoolsv.exe,Monitoring newly constructed files that might be used for persistence,Monitoring user logins for suspicious activity,D,The text outlines monitoring process API calls to AddMonitor, monitoring DLLs loaded by spoolsv.exe, and monitoring newly constructed files. Monitoring user logins is not specifically mentioned as a detection method for this technique.
What level of privileges does the adversary-supplied DLL typically run with when using the Port Monitors sub-technique of Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (T1547.004) on Windows?,User,Administrator,System,Guest,C,The text states that the DLL will be loaded and run by the print spooler service under SYSTEM level permissions.
Which of the following MITRE ATT&CK tactics is most relevant to the Port Monitors sub-technique of Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (T1547.004) on Windows?,Persistence,Lateral Movement,Command and Control,Credential Access,A,The Port Monitors technique is primarily focused on achieving persistence, as it allows an adversary to execute a DLL at system boot.
What is the purpose of using the Autoruns utility in the context of detecting the Port Monitors sub-technique of Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (T1547.004) on Windows?,To monitor network traffic for suspicious connections,To identify malicious files that are loaded at system startup,To analyze system memory for signs of compromise,To scan for vulnerabilities in the operating system,B,Autoruns is a tool used to check for programs and registry entries that run at system startup, making it useful for detecting persistence mechanisms like Port Monitors.
Which of the following is a valid mitigation for the Port Monitors sub-technique of Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (T1547.004) on Windows?,Disabling the print spooler service,Disabling the AddMonitor API call,Regularly reviewing the HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors registry key,Implementing application whitelisting,C,The text explicitly states that the Port Monitors technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls. However, regularly reviewing the relevant registry key can help detect potential misuse.
What is the recommended approach for detecting the Port Monitors sub-technique of Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (T1547.004) on Windows? Choose the most effective option.,Monitoring the creation of new DLLs in the System32 directory,Analyzing system logs for suspicious events,Monitoring the execution of spoolsv.exe,Using a network intrusion detection system,A,The text recommends monitoring new DLLs written to the System32 directory for suspicious activity, as this is a key indicator of this specific technique.
What is the primary advantage of using the Port Monitors sub-technique of Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (T1547.004) on Windows?,It allows an adversary to escalate privileges to SYSTEM level,It enables an adversary to bypass security software,It provides an adversary with persistence on the compromised system,It allows an adversary to steal sensitive data,C,The Port Monitors technique primarily focuses on achieving persistence by running a DLL at system boot, ensuring the adversary's presence even after a reboot.
