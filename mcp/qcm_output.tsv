Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What technique ID and name does the text describe for bypassing UAC on Windows systems by modifying Registry settings?,T1548.003, T1548.004, T1548.005, T1548.006,C,T1548.005, Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism, which refers to the technique ID T1548.005, "Modify Registry".,
What is the recommended mitigation for preventing an adversary from escalating privileges through the abuse of the "sudo" command on Linux systems?,Enable the "timestamp_timeout" setting,Disable the "timestamp_timeout" setting,Require password for all commands executed with "sudo",Disable "LOG_INPUT" and "LOG_OUTPUT" directives in the "/etc/sudoers" file,C,Require password for all commands executed with "sudo",The text recommends setting the "timestamp_timeout" to 0, which forces the user to input their password every time sudo is executed. This prevents an adversary from abusing sudo without knowing the password. ,
Which of the following is NOT a technique described in the text for monitoring potential privilege escalation attempts on Linux systems?,Monitoring the "/usr/libexec/security_authtrampoline" execution,Auditing events where the user's actual and effective IDs differ,Monitoring for "Get System" activity,Monitoring for processes with the "setuid" or "setgid" bits set,C,Monitoring for "Get System" activity,This technique is specifically related to Windows systems and not mentioned as a way to monitor privilege escalation on Linux systems. ,
What MITRE ATT&CK technique does the analytic "Get System Elevation" target?,T1055, T1059.003, T1059.004, T1059.005,D,T1059.005,The text describes the analytic as looking for techniques used to "Get System," which directly relates to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1059.005, "Command and Scripting Interpreter." ,
What type of MITRE ATT&CK platform is the "Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism" technique applicable to?,Enterprise,ICS,Mobile,All of the above,D,All of the above,This technique is applicable to all MITRE ATT&CK platforms because it describes ways that adversaries can abuse privilege escalation mechanisms that exist across various operating systems and environments.
