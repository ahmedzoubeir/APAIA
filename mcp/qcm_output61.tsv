Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is the MITRE ATT&CK technique ID and name for adversaries exploiting accessibility features to gain persistence and privileges on a Windows system?,T1134,T1196,T1059.003,T1547.001,A,This technique leverages Windows accessibility features to gain persistence and escalate privileges. It falls under the broader category of "Event Triggered Execution" (T1134).,
Which of these is NOT a common accessibility program used by adversaries for unauthorized access on Windows systems?,C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe,C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe,C:\Windows\System32\mspaint.exe,C:\Windows\System32\osk.exe,C,The mentioned programs are commonly used by attackers. mspaint.exe is a simple image editor and is not typically used for malicious purposes.,
What is the primary mechanism used by adversaries to exploit accessibility features in newer Windows versions where the replaced binary needs to be digitally signed?,Image File Execution Options Injection,Registry Manipulation,Process Hollowing,Direct Binary Replacement,A,Image File Execution Options Injection is a common workaround as it bypasses the requirement for digital signing and binary replacement.,
Which of these is NOT a mitigation strategy for the Event Triggered Execution technique using accessibility features?,Disable accessibility features,Utilize application control tools like Windows Defender Application Control,Enable Network Level Authentication for RDP connections,Implement strong password policies,D,Strong password policies are essential for overall security but do not directly address the exploitation of accessibility features.,
Which of these event IDs is associated with PowerShell script blocks, which can be used to detect the abuse of accessibility features?,Event ID 4104,Event ID 4688,Event ID 1024,Event ID 1,A,Event ID 4104 in the Microsoft-Windows-Powershell/Operational log is specifically associated with PowerShell script blocks, allowing analysis for potential abuse of accessibility features.,
What is the most effective way to prevent adversaries from reaching the Windows login screen without first authenticating when using accessibility feature exploitation through RDP?,Enable Network Level Authentication (NLA),Disable accessibility features,Utilize a Remote Desktop Gateway,Implement strong password policies,A,Enabling NLA ensures remote desktop sessions authenticate before the login screen is displayed, preventing attackers from reaching the login screen without authentication.,
Which of the following is a potential limitation of the "Analytic 2 - Debuggers for Accessibility Applications" example provided in the text?,Potential for false positives,Inability to detect process creation events,Reliance on specific registry keys,Dependence on specific command line arguments,A,The analytic relies on the presence of specific strings in the command line, which could lead to false positives if these strings are used for legitimate purposes.,
What is the main purpose of the "Debugger" option within the Windows Registry location HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options?,To enable debugging features for specific applications,To monitor and log application execution events,To set parameters for application execution during debugging,To automatically launch a specific debugger for specific applications,D,The "Debugger" option allows an attacker to specify a debugging command line that will execute instead of the original application, enabling them to gain control.,
What type of log should be monitored for changes made to files that might indicate exploitation of accessibility features for persistence or privilege escalation?,Security log,Application log,System log,Powershell log,A,The Security log is most relevant for monitoring file changes, especially those potentially linked to malicious activities targeting accessibility features.,
What is the significance of monitoring command line invocation of tools capable of modifying the Registry related to accessibility features?,It can reveal attempts to modify the configuration of accessibility features,It can indicate the installation of malware through accessibility features,It can identify suspicious access to system files,It can detect the creation of new user accounts,A,Monitoring such actions directly helps identify attempts to alter the behavior of accessibility features, potentially pointing to malicious activity.
