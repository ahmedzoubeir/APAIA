**Question 1**
MITRE ATT&CK Platform: Enterprise
MITRE ATT&CK Technique: Credential Access: Phishing

In the context of MITRE ATT&CK Credential Access: Phishing, how can an organization mitigate the risk of users authenticating with untrustworthy services?
(A) Use multi-factor authentication on all accounts
(B) Implement anti-spam filters and firewalls
(C) Deploy intrusion detection and prevention systems
(D) Educate users about phishing and social engineering

**Correct Answer: D**
Explanation: The primary method of defense when dealing with phishing attacks is user awareness and education. Educate users on phishing tactics, brand impersonation, and other social engineering techniques.

**Question 2**
MITRE ATT&CK Platform: ICS
MITRE ATT&CK Technique: Exfiltration Over Network: Web Service

Which of the following is a typical objective of Exfiltration Over Network: Web Service in an ICS environment?
(A) Gain remote access to critical systems
(B) Modify device configurations
(C) Extract sensitive operational data
(D) Disrupt network communication

**Correct Answer: C**
Explanation: Exfiltration Over Network: Web Service aims to transfer data out of the ICS network via web services. This often involves obtaining sensitive operational data from the ICS environment.

**Question 3**
MITRE ATT&CK Platform: Mobile
MITRE ATT&CK Technique: Persistence: Remote Access Trojan (RAT)

In the context of MITRE ATT&CK Persistence: Remote Access Trojan (RAT), which of the following is a signature indicator of compromise (IOC)?
(A) Presence of known malicious code binaries
(B) Suspicious network traffic connecting to external domains
(C) Unauthorized changes to system files
(D) Active listening services on unusual ports

**Correct Answer: B**
Explanation: RATs often establish persistent connections to external command and control (C2) servers. Identifying suspicious network traffic to unknown domains is a typical IOC for RAT activity.

**Question 4**
MITRE ATT&CK Platform: Enterprise
MITRE ATT&CK Technique: Reconnaissance: External Reconnaissance

Which of the following sources is most frequently used by attackers for External Reconnaissance?
(A) Vulnerability scanners
(B) OSINT tools
(C) Network scans
(D) Social media profiles

**Correct Answer: B**
Explanation: OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tools, such as Google Dorks, Maltego, and Shodan, are commonly used by attackers to gather information about potential targets without interacting with them directly.

**Question 5**
MITRE ATT&CK Platform: ICS
MITRE ATT&CK Technique: Execution: Process Injection

In an ICS environment, which of the following is a potential consequence of successful Execution: Process Injection?
(A) Loss of sensitive data
(B) Denial of service to critical systems
(C) Theft of user credentials
(D) Modification of process parameters

**Correct Answer: D**
Explanation: In an ICS environment, attackers often inject malicious code into legitimate processes to manipulate or modify the behavior of ICS components, potentially altering process parameters and disrupting operations.
