"Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation"				
"What is a potential malicious outcome of an adversary modifying domain or tenant policy settings?,,Changing the trust settings for domains.,Temporarily modifying domain policy and then reverting the change.,Adding a new federated identity provider.,All of the above.,D,Modifying domain or tenant policy settings can lead to various malicious outcomes, including changing trust settings, temporarily modifying policy and then reverting the change, and adding a new federated identity provider."				
"What technique ID and name from the MITRE ATT&CK framework describes the adversary action of modifying domain or tenant policy settings?,,T1134, Domain or Tenant Policy Modification,,T1556, Create Accounts,,T1559, Modify Permissions,,T1543, Steal or Forge Credentials,,A,T1134, Domain or Tenant Policy Modification, accurately describes the adversary action of modifying domain or tenant policy settings to evade defenses and/or escalate privileges."				
"Which of the following is NOT a recommended mitigation for Domain or Tenant Policy Modification attacks?,,Identify and correct GPO permissions abuse opportunities.,Use least privilege and protect administrative access to the Domain Controller and Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) server.,Create service accounts with administrative privileges.,Consider implementing WMI and security filtering.,C,Creating service accounts with administrative privileges directly contradicts the principle of least privilege and increases the risk of unauthorize"	d access	an	d potential misuse.	
"Which event ID can be used to monitor for unexpected deletion of an Active Directory object?,,Windows EID 5141,,Windows EID 5137,,Windows EID 4718,,Windows EID 4719,,A,Windows EID 5141 specifically tracks events related to the unexpected deletion of Active Directory objects, enabling security teams to monitor for suspicious activities."				
"Which of the following actions should be monitored for potential Domain or Tenant Policy Modification attacks in an Okta environment?,,The event system.idp.lifecycle.create,,User sign-ins from a third-party identity provider,,Changes to the Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) server configuration,,All of the above,,D,Monitoring all the listed actions (system.idp.lifecycle.create, user sign-ins from a third-party identity provider, and changes to AD FS configuration) provides a comprehensive approach to detecting potential policy modification"	attacks	in	an Okta environmen	t.
"Which of the following tools can be used to identify and correct GPO permissions abuse opportunities?,,BloodHound (version 1.5.1 and later),,Splunk,,Sysmon,,Nessus,,A,BloodHound (version 1.5.1 and later) is specifically designed to identify and visualize relationships within Active Directory, including GPO permissions, helping security professionals identify potential abuse opportunities."				
"What is a common tactic used by adversaries to evade detection after modifying domain or tenant policy settings?,,They temporarily modify the policy, carry out their malicious actions, and then revert the change.,They use advanced evasion techniques to bypass security controls.,They leverage zero-day vulnerabilities to gain access.,They create a new service account with administrative privileges.,A,Adversaries often revert policy changes after completing their malicious actions to remove suspicious indicators and evade detection, making this a common"	tactic	for	bypassing security	measures.
"What security principle is recommended to mitigate the risk of Domain or Tenant Policy Modification attacks by limiting the access rights of users and service accounts?,,Least Privilege,,Data Loss Prevention (DLP),,Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA),,Zero Trust,,A,The principle of Least Privilege mandates granting users and service accounts only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks, reducing the impact of potential compromise and minimizing attack surface."				
"Which of the following is NOT a potential indicator of Domain or Tenant Policy Modification attacks?,,Changes to domain trust settings.,Changes to user account attributes like credentials or status.,Changes to Active Directory object permissions.,Unexpected login attempts from a new user account.,D,Unexpected login attempts from a new user account are more indicative of credential theft or unauthorized access rather than a direct modification of domain or tenant policy settings."				
"What is a critical step in detecting and mitigating Domain or Tenant Policy Modification attacks in cloud environments?,,Monitor changes to cloud-based directory services and identity tenants.,Implement strong password policies.,Use multi-factor authentication for user accounts.,Enforce least privilege access controls.,A,Monitoring changes to cloud-based directory services and identity tenants is crucial for detecting any modifications that could indicate malicious activity related to domain or tenant policy, enabling timely mitigation."
