Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What MITRE ATT&CK technique ID and name corresponds to the technique of granting additional email delegate permissions for persistent access to an adversary-controlled account?,T1134, Account Manipulation,T1135,  Access Token Manipulation,T1136,  Credentials from Password Stores,T1098,  Account Discovery,A,This technique falls under the umbrella of Account Manipulation (T1134) as it directly involves manipulating account privileges and permissions.
In the context of an adversary granting additional permissions to a compromised email account for persistent access, which MITRE ATT&CK technique is specifically relevant?,T1136,  Credentials from Password Stores,T1134, Account Manipulation,T1098,  Account Discovery,T1135, Access Token Manipulation,B,While the act of granting additional permissions to a compromised email account for persistent access is generally categorized under Account Manipulation (T1134), it doesn't specifically align with the other mentioned techniques. Techniques like "Credentials from Password Stores" (T1136), "Access Token Manipulation" (T1135), and "Account Discovery" (T1098) focus on different aspects of account compromise.
In the context of Office 365, what PowerShell cmdlet is used by adversaries to grant permissions to a mailbox?,,Set-Mailbox,Add-MailboxPermission,Get-MailboxPermission,Remove-MailboxPermission,B,The document specifically mentions the "Add-MailboxPermission" PowerShell cmdlet for granting permissions to mailboxes in both on-premises Exchange and Office 365.
Which of the following examples is NOT cited as an instance of an adversary using Additional Email Delegate Permissions?,,APT28 granting ApplicationImpersonation role to a compromised account,APT29 using a compromised global administrator account to backdoor a service principal,APT29 using compromised accounts holding ApplicationImpersonation rights in Exchange to collect emails,Magic Hound granting read access to email boxes of additional targeted accounts,B,The document explicitly mentions the use of a compromised global administrator account to backdoor a service principal for collecting emails. However, it doesn't specify any instances of adversaries using compromised accounts to directly backdoor service principals for the purpose of granting additional email delegate permissions.
What type of permission does Magic Hound grant to compromised email accounts in order to access additional targeted accounts?,Full control,Read access,Write access,Send as,B,The document states that Magic Hound grants compromised email accounts "read access" to the email boxes of additional targeted accounts, enabling them to authenticate to the intended victim's OWA portal and read email communications.
In the context of the SolarWinds Compromise, what permissions did APT29 add to compromised Application or Service Principals?,Mail.Send,Mail.ReadWrite,Mail.Read,All of the above,D,The document mentions APT29 adding "Mail.Read" and "Mail.ReadWrite" permissions to compromised Application or Service Principals during the SolarWinds Compromise. This indicates the inclusion of both read and write access permissions to email content.
Which of the following is NOT a mitigation against Additional Email Delegate Permissions?,,Disable email delegation if not required,Use multi-factor authentication for user and privileged accounts,Use strong passwords for all accounts,Do not allow domain administrator accounts for day-to-day operations,C,The document highlights disabling email delegation, implementing multi-factor authentication, and restricting domain administrator account usage as mitigations.  However, strong password policy, while important, is not specifically mentioned in the context of this technique.
Which of the following is NOT a detection method for Additional Email Delegate Permissions?,,Monitor for unusual Exchange and Office 365 email account permissions changes,Enable the UpdateFolderPermissions action for all logon types,Create rules to alert on ModifyFolderPermissions operations,Observe the user's browsing history for suspicious activity,D,The document mentions enabling the UpdateFolderPermissions action, creating rules for ModifyFolderPermissions alerts, and monitoring for unusual permission changes. However, it doesn't specifically mention using browsing history for detecting this technique.
Which of the following is an indicator of potential account compromise related to Additional Email Delegate Permissions?,,A large volume of emails sent from an account,Similar phishing emails sent from real accounts within a network,A sudden increase in the number of login attempts,A large number of outgoing emails to international destinations,A and B,E,The document highlights two potential indicators: a large volume of emails sent from an account and similar phishing emails sent from real accounts, both suggesting possible account compromise and abuse of modified email permissions.
What is the primary goal of adversaries employing the Additional Email Delegate Permissions technique within the context of BEC (Business Email Compromise)?,,Gain access to sensitive data,Establish persistent access to the compromised account,Disrupt business operations,Evade spam/phishing detection mechanisms,D,The document mentions adversaries using compromised business accounts to send messages that evade spam/phishing detection mechanisms. This aligns with the goal of using the technique for BEC purposes.
