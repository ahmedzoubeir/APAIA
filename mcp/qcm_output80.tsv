Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is the primary goal of an adversary using the "Hijack Execution Flow" technique (T1546.001)?  ,Obtain user credentials.,Execute malicious code with elevated privileges.,Disable system security services.,Modify system configuration settings.,B,This technique aims to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones, granting the attacker higher permissions and potential persistence.
Which of the following techniques could be used to detect a potential "Hijack Execution Flow" attack?  ,Monitoring user account login attempts.,Analyzing network traffic for suspicious patterns.,Monitoring for unexpected binary or service executable modifications.,Detecting attempts to access sensitive files.,C,The document specifically mentions monitoring for modifications of binaries and service executables that are not part of scheduled updates as a key detection strategy.
Which MITRE ATT&CK pattern technique is commonly used in conjunction with "Hijack Execution Flow" (T1546.001) to achieve persistence?  ,T1059.003 (Credential Dumping),T1057 (Process Injection),T1547 (Windows Management Instrumentation),T1115 (Execution through Scheduled Task),D,The text states that if the hijacked service is set to run at a specific time or during an event, it can be used for persistence. This aligns with the T1115 technique, which involves executing code through scheduled tasks.
Which of the following mitigation strategies directly addresses the vulnerability exploited by "Hijack Execution Flow" (T1546.001)?  ,Implementing strong password policies.,Enabling multi-factor authentication.,Restricting service file system permissions.,Enforcing data loss prevention policies.,C,The vulnerability lies in the improper permissions on service binary files, which can be exploited to replace them with malicious ones. Restricting service file system permissions directly mitigates this weakness.
What is a potential advantage of enabling installer detection in the context of "Hijack Execution Flow" (T1546.001) mitigation?  ,It automatically denies elevation requests.,It prevents the installation of malicious software.,It logs installation attempts and prompts for a password.,It blocks all executable files from being downloaded.,C,Enabling installer detection logs installation attempts, prompts for a password, and provides a layer of security against potential privilege escalation during installation, which could be exploited in "Hijack Execution Flow" attacks.
Which of the following tools can be used to explore systems for service file system permissions weaknesses, potentially identifying vulnerabilities exploitable by "Hijack Execution Flow" (T1546.001)?  ,Metasploit.,PowerSploit.,Nessus.,Wireshark.,B,The document explicitly mentions PowerSploit framework containing PowerUp modules specifically designed for exploring service file system permissions vulnerabilities, making it relevant for detecting "Hijack Execution Flow" risks.
What is a key aspect of defensive strategies to mitigate the threat of "Hijack Execution Flow" (T1546.001) within an enterprise environment?  ,Centralized logging and incident response.,Regular security awareness training for users.,Limiting user privileges and restricting access.,Automated malware detection and removal.,C,The document emphasizes limiting privileges of user accounts and groups, ensuring only authorized administrators can modify service configurations and binary locations, which aligns with a key defensive strategy.
Which of the following scenarios would be considered a potential indicator of a "Hijack Execution Flow" (T1546.001) attack?  ,A user's account being locked due to multiple failed login attempts.,An unexpected service executable file being created on a system.,A website redirecting the user to a phishing page.,A system experiencing a denial-of-service attack.,B,The document highlights monitoring for the creation of unexpected binary or service executable files as a potential indication of a "Hijack Execution Flow" attack.
What is the primary purpose of hashing service executables in the context of "Hijack Execution Flow" (T1546.001) detection?  ,To identify malicious code within the executables.,To ensure the integrity of the executables and detect modifications.,To encrypt the executables for confidentiality.,To authenticate the executables and prevent unauthorized access.,B,Hashing executables allows for comparison against historical data, enabling the detection of any replacements or modifications that might indicate a "Hijack Execution Flow" attack.
What is the best approach to mitigate the "Hijack Execution Flow" (T1546.001) technique by applying the principle of least privilege in an enterprise environment?  ,Disable all services that are not essential for operations.,Restrict user access to critical system files.,Enforce strong password policies for all users.,Limit administrative privileges to authorized personnel.,D,Applying the principle of least privilege in this context means minimizing the number of users with administrative rights, allowing them to only perform tasks essential for their roles, making it more difficult for adversaries to gain elevated privileges through "Hijack Execution Flow" attacks.
