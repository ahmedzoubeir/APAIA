Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
Which of the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques is described in the provided text, focusing on the modification of SSH authorized_keys files for persistence on a victim host within the Enterprise domain?,T1547.001,T1018.003,T1087,T1098,A,The provided text describes the technique of modifying SSH authorized_keys files, which is directly associated with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1547.001: Account Manipulation - SSH Authorized Keys.
How can adversaries use cloud environments to modify SSH authorized_keys files?,By exploiting vulnerabilities in the cloud infrastructure's security protocols,By using command line interfaces or REST APIs provided by the cloud platform,By manipulating the cloud provider's billing system,By leveraging social engineering techniques against cloud administrators,B,The text explicitly states that adversaries can modify SSH authorized_keys files via command line interfaces or REST APIs within cloud environments, making this the primary method.
Which of the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques might be leveraged by adversaries to achieve privilege escalation after modifying SSH authorized_keys files in cloud environments?,T1087,T1547.001,T1069,T1018.003,A,Privilege escalation after modifying SSH authorized_keys files in cloud environments aligns with the technique T1087: Privilege Escalation. This technique involves gaining access to higher-privileged accounts or permissions.
What mitigation strategy is specifically mentioned in the text for preventing the modification of SSH authorized_keys files?,Restricting access to the authorized_keys file,Disabling SSH completely on all systems,Using strong passwords for all user accounts,Enabling two-factor authentication for all SSH logins,A,The text directly highlights restricting access to the authorized_keys file as a specific mitigation strategy for preventing its modification.
Which of the following examples from the text demonstrates how adversaries leverage SSH authorized_keys manipulation for persistence?,Skidmap adding the public key of its handlers to the authorized_keys file,Bundlore creating a new key pair with ssh-keygen,Earth Lusca dropping an SSH-authorized key in the /root/.ssh folder,TeamTNT adding RSA keys in authorized_keys,A,Skidmap adding the public key of its handlers to the authorized_keys file specifically illustrates the use of SSH authorized_keys manipulation for persistence, as stated in the text.
What is a common location for the SSH authorized_keys file on a Linux system?,/etc/ssh/sshd_config,~/authorized_keys,~/user-home/.ssh/authorized_keys,~/authorized_keys/user-home,C,The text states that the authorized_keys file is typically located in the user's home directory under <user-home>/.ssh/authorized_keys, making this the correct answer.
Which of the following is NOT a common detection method for SSH authorized_keys manipulation, as described in the text?,Monitoring changes to the authorized_keys file for each user,Monitoring executed commands and arguments to modify the authorized_keys file,Monitoring suspicious processes modifying the authorized_keys or /etc/ssh/sshd_config files,Monitoring network traffic for SSH key exchanges,D,The provided text focuses on detection methods related to file modifications and command executions, not network traffic analysis.
What is the purpose of the "add-metadata" command mentioned in the text within the context of SSH authorized_keys manipulation?,To add a new user account to the virtual machine,To modify the authorized_keys file of a user account,To delete an existing SSH key from the authorized_keys file,To install security patches for the virtual machine's operating system,B,The text clarifies that the "add-metadata" command is used to add SSH keys to a user account within the context of cloud environments, directly influencing the authorized_keys file.
Which of the following techniques could an attacker potentially use to modify an SSH authorized_keys file on a network device?,T1083: File and Directory Discovery,T1082: System Information Discovery,T1104: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges,T1040: Network Sniffing,B,The text mentions the use of the "ip ssh pubkey-chain" command on network devices, which is associated with system information discovery (T1082). This technique helps attackers gain knowledge about the device's configuration and SSH keys.
How does the manipulation of SSH authorized_keys files relate to the principle of least privilege?,It contradicts the principle by granting unnecessary access to users,It supports the principle by ensuring only authorized users have access,It has no direct relation to the principle of least privilege,It helps enforce the principle by automatically revoking access to unauthorized users,A,Manipulating SSH authorized_keys files often violates the principle of least privilege by granting unauthorized users access, potentially exceeding the necessary privileges for their tasks.
