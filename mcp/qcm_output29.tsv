Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is the MITRE ATT&CK technique ID and name for the technique described in the provided text?,T1547.001,T1547,T1059.005,T1059,A,The text describes the "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution" technique with the ID T1547.001 and the name "Re-opened Applications".,
Which of the following actions by an adversary would NOT be considered a sub-technique of "Re-opened Applications" within the MITRE ATT&CK framework?,Adding a malicious application to the com.apple.loginwindow.[UUID].plist file,Modifying the launchd.plist file to automatically start a malicious application,Creating a scheduled task to execute a malicious application upon user login,Setting up a malicious browser extension that automatically runs on startup,D,Options A, B, and C are all techniques for achieving persistence through autostart execution, whereas option D focuses on web browser extensions.,
Which of the following is NOT a valid mitigation for the "Re-opened Applications" technique?,Disabling the "Reopen windows when logging back in" option,Deleting the com.apple.loginwindow.[UUID].plist file,Disabling persistence in macOS,Holding the Shift key during login to prevent auto-opening of applications,C,Deleting the com.apple.loginwindow.[UUID].plist file is a temporary solution as it will be recreated upon the next logon. Disabling persistence in macOS, option C, would be a more effective and permanent solution.,
What is the specific file that adversaries might modify to achieve persistence through the "Re-opened Applications" technique?,com.apple.loginwindow.[UUID].plist,launchd.plist,com.apple.system.plist,com.apple.loginitems.plist,A,The text explicitly states that adversaries modify the com.apple.loginwindow.[UUID].plist file to achieve persistence through the "Re-opened Applications" technique.,
Which of the following would be the most effective detection method for identifying potential adversaries exploiting the "Re-opened Applications" technique?,Monitoring for changes in the com.apple.loginwindow.[UUID].plist file,Analyzing network traffic for suspicious connections,Auditing user login attempts,Monitoring file system activity for unusual file creations,A,The most effective detection method is monitoring for changes in the com.apple.loginwindow.[UUID].plist file as this directly indicates an attempt to manipulate the auto-reopening of applications.,
According to the text, which of the following actions by a user can prevent the automatic opening of applications during login?,Holding the Shift key,Holding the Control key,Holding the Option key,Holding the Command key,A,The text explicitly states that holding the Shift key while logging in prevents apps from opening automatically.,
Which of the following statements accurately describes the MITRE ATT&CK platform relevant to the "Re-opened Applications" technique?,The technique is relevant to both Enterprise and Mobile platforms,The technique is specifically applicable to the Mobile platform,The technique is applicable to the Enterprise platform,The technique is primarily focused on ICS systems,C,The provided text focuses on macOS, which is considered part of the Enterprise platform within the MITRE ATT&CK framework.,
Which of the following best describes the type of persistence technique employed by the "Re-opened Applications" technique?,Application Persistence,User Account Persistence,Registry Persistence,Boot or Logon Autostart Execution,D,The text explicitly describes the "Re-opened Applications" technique as a sub-technique of "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution" which is categorized as a persistence technique.,
Which of the following MITRE ATT&CK tactics does the "Re-opened Applications" technique primarily contribute to?,Persistence,Collection,Lateral Movement,Command and Control,A,The "Re-opened Applications" technique is primarily focused on establishing persistence, allowing the adversary to maintain access to the system even after the user logs out or restarts the device.,
Which of the following commands could be used to disable the automatic reopening of applications during login?,defaults write -g ApplePersistence -bool no,defaults delete com.apple.loginwindow -bool no,defaults write com.apple.loginwindow -bool no,defaults write com.apple.loginwindow.[UUID].plist -bool no,A,The text explicitly mentions that running the command `defaults write -g ApplePersistence -bool no` disables the automatic reopening of applications during login.
