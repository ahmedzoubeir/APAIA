Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is the primary purpose of a Launch Agent in macOS? ,To execute system utilities on startup.,To provide background services for applications.,To automate user-defined tasks at login.,To update software components regularly.,C,Launch Agents are designed to automate user-defined tasks, such as launching applications or executing scripts, at login. They are not primarily used for system utilities, background services, or software updates.,
Which of the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques describes the use of Launch Agents for persistence? ,T1059.003 -  Launch Agent ,T1059.007 -  Windows Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder ,T1563.001 -  Create or Modify System Process ,T1563.002 -  Create or Modify System Process:  Hijack Execution Flow ,C,The technique "T1563.001 -  Create or Modify System Process" covers the general concept of manipulating system processes for persistence, and Launch Agents are a specific example of this technique on macOS.,
Which of the following is NOT a mitigation strategy against Launch Agent abuse? ,Enforcing file permissions on the ~/Library/LaunchAgents folder.,Using an endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution to monitor for suspicious launch agent activity.,Monitoring changes to the ProgramArguments key of Launch Agents.,Disabling the Launchd service in the macOS settings.,D,Disabling Launchd would significantly impact system functionality and is not a recommended mitigation strategy. The other options are valid and effective mitigation measures.,
What are the common key-value pairs used in Launch Agent property list (.plist) files to enable persistence? ,Label and ProgramArguments ,RunAtLoad and KeepAlive ,ProgramArguments and RunAtLoad ,KeepAlive and Label ,B,The RunAtLoad and KeepAlive keys are critical for establishing persistence. RunAtLoad ensures the Launch Agent executes at user login, while KeepAlive keeps it running even after the user logs out.,
Which of the following is NOT a known malware that utilizes Launch Agents for persistence? ,Bundlore ,CoinTicker ,MacMa ,Metasploit ,D,Metasploit is a penetration testing framework and does not have a known variant that utilizes Launch Agents for persistence. The other options are known malware families that exploit Launch Agents for persistence.,
How does KnockKnock, a tool developed by Objective-See, help in detecting Launch Agent-related threats? ,It monitors for changes in the system's boot process. ,It detects suspicious network connections initiated by Launch Agents. ,It analyzes the contents of Launch Agent property list files for malicious activity. ,It identifies unauthorized modifications to the /tmp and /shared folders.,C,KnockKnock specifically focuses on analyzing Launch Agent property list files to detect malicious configurations and actions. It doesn't directly monitor boot processes, network connections, or file changes in /tmp and /shared folders.,
Which of the following is a key indicator of a compromised Launch Agent? ,A Launch Agent with a ProgramArguments key pointing to an executable in the /tmp folder. ,A Launch Agent with a RunAtLoad key set to true. ,A Launch Agent with a Label key matching a legitimate system process name. ,Both A and B. ,D,Both options A and B are strong indicators of a compromised Launch Agent. Executing from /tmp and using RunAtLoad for persistence are typical signs of malicious behavior.,
What is a crucial factor to consider when monitoring Launch Agents for suspicious activity? ,The location of the Launch Agent property list file. ,The time of creation of the Launch Agent. ,The username under which the Launch Agent is running. ,All of the above. ,D,All of these factors are essential for assessing the legitimacy and potential risk associated with a Launch Agent. The location, time of creation, and username can all provide valuable clues to identify suspicious behavior.,
Which of the following is NOT an appropriate defensive strategy against Launch Agent threats on macOS? ,Regularly auditing the ~/Library/LaunchAgents folder for unauthorized files. ,Using a security information and event management (SIEM) system to detect suspicious Launch Agent activity. ,Implementing a strict access control policy for system administrator accounts. ,Installing and running antivirus software on all macOS devices. ,D,While antivirus software can be helpful in detecting malware, it's not a primary defense against Launch Agent threats. The other options are more effective and targeted defensive strategies for preventing and mitigating Launch Agent abuse. ,
What are the most crucial factors to consider when implementing a security policy related to Launch Agents? ,The allowed locations for Launch Agent files. ,The allowed values for the RunAtLoad key. ,The allowed names for Launch Agent property list files. ,Both A and B. ,D,The most crucial factors are the allowed locations for Launch Agent files and the allowed values for the RunAtLoad key. These aspects directly control where Launch Agents can be installed and whether they execute at user login. While the file name can be a consideration, it's less critical than the other two factors.
