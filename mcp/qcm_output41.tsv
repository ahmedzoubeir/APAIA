Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is the primary purpose of network logon scripts in the context of this text?,To establish persistence on a network.,To provide users with network access credentials.,To automate user account creation and management.,To install and configure network applications.,A,Network logon scripts are described as a means for adversaries to establish persistence on a network.
Which of the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques is directly relevant to the use of network logon scripts for persistence?,T1137 - Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts,T1059.001 - Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1547.001 - Create or Modify System Process,T1027.001 - Scheduled Task/Job,A,The text explicitly mentions "Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts" (T1137) as the relevant technique.
Which of the following mitigations is specifically recommended for addressing the threat posed by network logon scripts?,Restricting write access to logon scripts to specific administrators.,Disabling the use of logon scripts altogether.,Enforcing multi-factor authentication for all user accounts.,Monitoring user activity for suspicious behavior.,A,The text emphasizes the importance of restricting write access to logon scripts to prevent unauthorized modifications.
Which of the following detection strategies is NOT mentioned as a means to identify malicious activity related to network logon scripts?,Monitoring for changes made in Active Directory related to logon scripts.,Monitoring executed commands and arguments for logon scripts.,Analyzing network traffic for unusual patterns related to logon scripts.,Monitoring for newly constructed files by unusual accounts outside of normal administration duties.,C,The text specifically discusses monitoring changes in Active Directory, executed commands, and file modifications but does not mention network traffic analysis as a detection strategy.
Which of the following is a potential risk associated with the use of network logon scripts for persistence?,Adversaries can potentially gain access to sensitive data stored on the target system.,Network logon scripts can be used to remotely control infected systems.,Adversaries can use logon scripts to bypass security controls and escalate privileges.,All of the above.,D,All the mentioned options are potential risks associated with malicious use of network logon scripts. 
Which of the following scenarios BEST describes a situation where network logon scripts could be used by an attacker to establish persistence?,An attacker modifies a legitimate logon script to execute a malicious payload every time a user logs in.,An attacker uses a social engineering attack to gain access to a network administrator's account and modify logon scripts.,An attacker uses a phishing email to trick a user into executing a malicious script that creates a backdoor on their system.,An attacker uses a vulnerability in a network service to gain unauthorized access to the system and installs a malicious program.,A,The scenario describes the attacker leveraging a legitimate logon script for malicious purposes, directly aligning with the persistence mechanism discussed in the text.
What is the primary advantage for an adversary using network logon scripts to establish persistence compared to other techniques like scheduled tasks?,Network logon scripts provide a higher level of privilege and access to the system.,Network logon scripts can be more easily hidden from detection by security tools.,Network logon scripts are more reliable and less likely to be affected by system updates.,Network logon scripts allow for a broader range of actions and functionalities.,B,The text emphasizes that network logon scripts are run with the privileges of the user they are assigned to, suggesting a lower level of privilege compared to administrator accounts. The other options are not explicitly mentioned in the text.
What is the recommended level of privilege required to modify network logon scripts for security purposes?,Only authorized administrators should have access to modify logon scripts.,All users should have the ability to modify logon scripts to personalize their work environment.,Only users with specific technical roles should have access to modify logon scripts.,It depends on the specific security policy and organizational requirements.,A,The text emphasizes restricting write access to logon scripts to specific administrators, indicating that only authorized administrators should have the ability to modify them.
What is the relationship between the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1137 "Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts" and the concept of "Persistence" in cybersecurity?,T1137 is a specific technique that can be used to achieve persistence on a system.,Persistence is a broader concept that encompasses various techniques, including T1137.,T1137 is a sub-technique of Persistence and relies on other techniques to achieve persistence.,T1137 is a countermeasure to prevent persistence, while Persistence is a malicious goal.,B,The text states that adversaries may use network logon scripts to "maintain persistence on a network," implying that Persistence is a broader concept while T1137 is a technique contributing to it.
What is the primary security concern associated with the use of network logon scripts in the context of this text?,The use of network logon scripts can lead to the unauthorized execution of malicious code on user systems.,The use of network logon scripts can expose sensitive information stored on the network.,The use of network logon scripts can disrupt network operations and cause service outages.,The use of network logon scripts can create vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.,A,The text focuses on the risk of adversaries using logon scripts to establish persistence, which implies the unauthorized execution of malicious code on user systems.
