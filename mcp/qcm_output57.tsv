Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is the primary objective of an adversary who modifies shell configuration files like "/etc/profile" on a Linux system?,Establish persistence by executing malicious commands triggered by user actions.,Gain access to sensitive information stored in the system configuration files.,Disable security features by modifying system settings.,Elevate privileges by exploiting vulnerabilities in the shell configuration files.,A,The modification of shell configuration files like "/etc/profile" aims to execute malicious commands triggered by user actions, establishing persistence for the adversary.,
What is the primary difference in the shell configuration files utilized by macOS compared to Linux?,macOS utilizes a different shell, zsh, as the default shell, while Linux typically uses bash.,macOS utilizes a different configuration file structure, with "/etc/profile" being the main configuration file.,macOS uses separate configuration files for login and interactive shells, while Linux uses a single configuration file.,macOS uses configuration files that are not executed at startup, while Linux executes them at startup.,C,macOS uses distinct configuration files for login and interactive shells, such as "~/.zprofile" for login and "~/.zshrc" for interactive shells. In contrast, Linux typically uses a single file like "~/.bashrc" for both purposes.,
In the context of Event Triggered Execution (T1059.005), which of the following shell configuration files is targeted by adversaries for user-level persistence on Linux systems?,/etc/profile,/~/.bash_profile,/~/.bash_logout,/etc/profile.d,B,Adversaries often target "~/.bash_profile" for user-level persistence on Linux systems. This file is sourced when a user opens a command-line interface or connects remotely, allowing for malicious commands to be executed within the user's context.,
Which of the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques aligns with the concept of an adversary modifying shell configuration files to achieve persistence?,Persistence (T1059),Data Exfiltration (T1020),Lateral Movement (T1090),Privilege Escalation (T1068),A,Modifying shell configuration files for persistence aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique Persistence (T1059) specifically targeting Event Triggered Execution (T1059.005) within the Persistence category.,
What is a recommended defensive measure to mitigate the risk of adversaries modifying shell configuration files?,Restrict access to the shell configuration files to only authorized administrators.,Monitor system logs for unusual changes to shell configuration files.,Implement file integrity monitoring for shell configuration files.,All of the above.,D,All listed options are recommended defensive measures to mitigate the risk of adversaries modifying shell configuration files. Restricting access, monitoring changes, and implementing file integrity monitoring help detect and prevent unauthorized modifications.,
In the context of Event Triggered Execution (T1059.005), which of the following is a primary focus for threat detection?,Monitoring for newly created files that could be used to establish persistence.,Monitoring for changes to specific files that are commonly targeted for persistence.,Monitoring for execution of known malicious binaries.,All of the above.,D,All of the listed options are primary focuses for threat detection in the context of Event Triggered Execution (T1059.005). Monitoring for new files, changes to specific files, and the execution of known malicious binaries are critical for identifying malicious activity.,
Which of the following is an example of a "valid" shell option file path on a typical Linux system?,/etc/profile.d,/~/.bash_login,/etc/shells,/~/.bashrc,C,The "/etc/shells" file contains a list of "valid" shell options available on a Linux system. It is used to verify the legitimacy of shells being used by the system.,
Which of the following techniques can be leveraged to detect potential malicious activity related to shell configuration file modifications?,Analyzing system logs for unusual commands or file changes.,Monitoring for new files or changes in specific files.,Using file integrity monitoring tools to track alterations in sensitive files.,All of the above.,D,All of the listed techniques can be leveraged to detect potential malicious activity related to shell configuration file modifications. Analyzing logs, monitoring file changes, and using file integrity monitoring tools provide valuable insights into potential threats.,
Which of the following represents a possible mitigation strategy against adversaries modifying shell configuration files for persistence?,Making shell configuration files read-only for all users except authorized administrators.,Disabling user-level shell configuration files.,Utilizing file integrity monitoring tools to track changes in shell configuration files.,All of the above.,D,All of the listed options represent valid mitigation strategies against adversaries modifying shell configuration files. Making files read-only, disabling user-level configurations, and utilizing file integrity monitoring tools enhance security by limiting access and detecting changes.,
How can an organization enhance its defenses against adversaries who leverage shell configuration files to achieve persistence?,Implement strict access controls for shell configuration files, allowing only authorized personnel to modify them.,Regularly audit shell configuration files for any unauthorized modifications or suspicious additions.,Leverage file integrity monitoring tools to detect changes in shell configuration files and alert security teams.,All of the above.,D,Implementing strict access controls, auditing configuration files, and using file integrity monitoring tools are all essential for enhancing defenses against adversaries who leverage shell configuration files for persistence.,
