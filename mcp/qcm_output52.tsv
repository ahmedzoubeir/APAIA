Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is a primary mitigation strategy against adversaries exploiting domain or tenant policy modifications?  ,Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication.,Implement the principle of least privilege for administrative access.,Restrict access to domain trusts and identity tenants to specific users.,Regularly review and update domain trust settings.,B,The principle of least privilege limits the scope of potential damage from compromised accounts, making it a more effective mitigation than the other options.,
How do adversaries often exploit trust relationships in domain or tenant policy modifications?  ,They may add new domain trusts, change trust properties, or alter trust configurations.,They may impersonate legitimate users to gain unauthorized access.,They may use brute-force attacks to guess passwords and gain access.,They may exploit vulnerabilities in software to gain access.,A,This accurately describes the methods used by adversaries to manipulate trust relationships, which is the focus of the document. The other options are not specific to trust modification.,
Which MITRE ATT&CK technique ID best describes the strategy of modifying domain trusts to evade defenses?  ,T1550.003,T1550.002,T1078.004,T1087,B,T1550.002 specifically addresses "Domain Trust Modification", aligning with the document's focus on manipulating trust relationships.,
What is a potential indicator of malicious domain trust modification in a Microsoft Active Directory environment?  ,Changes to AD settings that modify domain trust settings without a legitimate reason.,The creation of new user accounts.,The use of PowerShell commands to manage domain users.,The deployment of new security updates.,A,Monitoring unexpected changes to domain trust settings is a key detection strategy for malicious modifications, as highlighted in the document.,
In Okta environments, what event triggers on the creation of a new identity provider?  ,user.authentication.auth_via_IDP,system.idp.lifecycle.create,domain.trust.modification,identity.provider.activation,B,This event is specifically mentioned in the document as an indicator of potential malicious activity involving identity providers in Okta environments.,
Which PowerShell command could be indicative of an attempt to modify domain federation settings?  ,Update-MSOLUser -UserPrincipalName "user@domain.com",Get-ADUser -Identity "user@domain.com",Update-MSOLFederatedDomain â€“DomainName: "Federated Domain Name",Get-ADObject -SearchBase "OU=Users,DC=domain,DC=com",C,This command is explicitly mentioned in the document as a potential tool for manipulating domain federation settings.,
What is the purpose of monitoring for Windows Event ID 5137 in a domain trust modification scenario?  ,To identify suspicious changes to domain trust settings.,To detect the creation of new user accounts.,To monitor for attempts to access sensitive files.,To assess the effectiveness of security policies.,A,This event ID specifically pertains to the creation of new Active Directory objects, which could indicate the addition of malicious entities to the domain.,
Which of the following is NOT a recommended detection strategy for domain or tenant policy modifications?  ,Monitor for unexpected changes to AD settings related to trust settings.,Monitor for PowerShell commands that update domain authentication.,Monitor for the creation of new federated identity providers.,Implement robust intrusion detection systems (IDS) on all network devices.,D,While IDS is valuable for network security, it is not specifically mentioned in the document as a key strategy for detecting domain or tenant policy modifications.,
What is the potential consequence of an adversary adding a federated identity provider to a victim's SSO tenant?  ,They can authenticate as any user of the tenant.,They can disable multi-factor authentication for all users.,They can gain access to the victim's entire network.,They can install malware on all devices connected to the tenant.,A,Adding a federated identity provider allows the adversary to bypass standard authentication mechanisms and impersonate any user, giving them control over the tenant's accounts.,
Which of the following is a common tool used to exploit domain or tenant policy modifications in Active Directory environments?  ,AADInternals,Mimikatz,Metasploit,Empire,A,AADInternals is explicitly mentioned in the document as a tool for creating backdoors and manipulating domain trust settings.,
