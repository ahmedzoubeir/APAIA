Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What technique does the document describe as exploiting a backward-compatibility setting in Windows 7 and later to bypass UAC?,T1548.002 - Bypass User Account Control,T1059.005 -  Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1127.001 -  Remote Services,T1083 -  File and Directory Discovery,A,The document states that BlackEnergy attempts to bypass default User Access Control (UAC) settings by exploiting a backward-compatibility setting found in Windows 7 and later.,T1548.002 - Bypass User Account Control is the technique described in the document.
What is a common way attackers disable UAC on a compromised system?,By exploiting vulnerabilities in the registry,By using social engineering,By manipulating security settings,By modifying the system's boot sequence,A,The document states that threat actors often, after compromising a machine, try to disable User Access Control (UAC) to escalate privileges. This is often done by changing the registry key for system policies using "reg.exe", a legitimate tool provided by Microsoft for modifying the registry via command prompt or scripts. This action interferes with UAC and may enable a threat actor to escalate privileges on the compromised system, thereby allowing further exploitation of the system.,Attackers often disable UAC by modifying the registry.
Which of the following tools or techniques is NOT mentioned in the document as having the capability to bypass UAC?,Cobalt Strike,Empire,SilentTrinity,Metasploit,D,While the document mentions Cobalt Strike, Empire, and SilentTrinity as tools that can bypass UAC, it does not mention Metasploit.,Metasploit is not mentioned in the document.
Which of the following Sysmon events can be used to create detections around registry key modifications in the context of UAC bypass?,Event ID 1,Event ID 12,Event ID 13,Event ID 14,D,The document specifically mentions Sysmon Event ID 12 (Registry Key Create/Delete), Sysmon Event ID 13 (Registry Value Set), and Sysmon Event ID 14 (Registry Key and Value Rename) as being useful for creating detections around Registry Key Modification in the context of UAC Bypass.,Sysmon Event ID 14 (Registry Key and Value Rename) is a useful event for detecting registry key modifications.
What MITRE ATT&CK technique does the “UACME #33” string in the provided analytic correspond to?,T1548.001 -  Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism,T1548.002 -  Bypass User Account Control,T1548.003 -  Create or Modify System Process,T1548.004 -  Create or Modify Registry Key,B,The provided analytic string "UACME #33" refers to UACME technique #33, which is a specific UAC bypass method. This technique falls under the broader category of "Bypass User Account Control", which is represented by the MITRE ATT&CK technique ID T1548.002.,T1548.002 - Bypass User Account Control is the correct answer.
Which of the following is NOT a suggested mitigation for UAC bypass vulnerabilities?,Disabling UAC entirely,Updating to the latest version of Windows,Checking for common UAC bypass weaknesses,Removing users from the local administrator group,A,The document suggests removing users from the local administrator group, updating to the latest version of Windows, and checking for common UAC bypass weaknesses. It does not recommend disabling UAC entirely, as it is a crucial security mechanism.,Disabling UAC entirely is not a recommended mitigation strategy.
What is the main purpose of the provided analytic 1 and analytic 2?,To detect attempts to disable UAC,To detect attempts to escalate privileges by bypassing UAC,To detect attempts to install malicious software,To detect attempts to steal user credentials,B,The analytic code provided is focused on identifying activities related to bypassing UAC and disabling UAC. These actions are primarily associated with escalating privileges on a system.,The provided analytics are designed to detect attempts to escalate privileges by bypassing UAC.
Which of the following UAC bypass methods is specifically mentioned in the document as exploiting the [HKEY_CURRENT_USER]\Software\Classes\mscfile\shell\open\command Registry key?,sdclt.exe,eventvwr.exe,fodhelper.exe,wusa.exe,B,The document explicitly states that the eventvwr.exe bypass uses the [HKEY_CURRENT_USER]\Software\Classes\mscfile\shell\open\command Registry key.,The eventvwr.exe bypass is the one exploiting this specific Registry key.
Which of the following is a valid reason why it is important to validate that detections for UAC Bypass are still relevant?,New UAC bypass methods are regularly discovered,Existing UAC bypass methods may be patched by Microsoft,UAC bypass techniques are very common,All of the above,D,The document states that new UAC bypass implementations are regularly found and existing implementations may be fixed (i.e., patched) by Microsoft in new builds of Windows. This highlights the importance of validation as new bypass methods emerge and existing ones are addressed.,New UAC bypass methods are constantly being discovered, and existing methods are patched by Microsoft, making validation crucial.
Which of the following groups is mentioned in the document as using the CMSTPLUA COM interface to bypass UAC?,Avaddon,Bad Rabbit,BRONZE BUTLER,All of the above,A,The document states that Avaddon bypasses UAC using the CMSTPLUA COM interface.,Avaddon is the group mentioned as using this specific bypass method.
