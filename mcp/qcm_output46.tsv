Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is the primary mechanism for establishing persistence using Systemd services, as described in the document?,Creating new service files,Altering the commands executed by a .service file's directive,Modifying the user directive a .service file executes as,All of the above,D,All of the mentioned techniques - creating new service files, altering commands, and modifying user directives - are used by adversaries to establish persistence through Systemd services.
What is the purpose of the "WantedBy=multi-user.target" configuration in the context of Systemd services, as exemplified by the Sandworm Team's GOGETTER exploit?,To ensure the service starts before the system boots up,To run the service when the system begins accepting user logins,To provide high priority to the service,To automatically restart the service if it crashes,B,The "WantedBy=multi-user.target" configuration ensures that the GOGETTER service starts when the system begins accepting user logins, thus establishing persistence.
Which of the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques directly relates to the manipulation of Systemd services for persistence?,T1057.001 - Create or Modify System Process: Systemd Service,T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1550.002 - User Execution: Non-System User,T1563.001 - Create or Modify System Process: User Execution,A,T1057.001 - Create or Modify System Process: Systemd Service directly addresses the manipulation of Systemd services for persistence, as described in the document.
In the context of Systemd service security, what is the significance of restricting read/write access to systemd unit files?,It prevents unauthorized users from installing malicious software,It mitigates the risk of unauthorized modification of service configurations,It limits the ability of attackers to exfiltrate sensitive data,It restricts the creation of new systemd services,B,Restricting read/write access to systemd unit files effectively mitigates the risk of unauthorized modification of service configurations, which is a critical defensive strategy.
Which of the following directories is NOT a common location for storing systemd service unit files?,/etc/systemd/system, /usr/lib/systemd/system/,/home//.config/systemd/user/,/var/log/systemd,D,/var/log/systemd is used for storing systemd logs, not for service unit files. The other directories are standard locations for systemd configuration.
Which of the following tools can be used to detect suspicious Systemd services based on their execution status?,systemctl,netstat,ps,who,A,The systemctl utility can be used to list and examine system services, allowing security professionals to identify suspicious or potentially malicious services.
Which of the following is NOT a recommended mitigation strategy for securing Systemd services, as described in the document?,Restricting software installation to trusted repositories only,Auditing file creation and modification events in systemd directories,Monitoring for new constructed systemd services,Disabling the systemctl utility for all users except administrators,D,Disabling the systemctl utility for all users except administrators is an overly restrictive measure that could hinder legitimate system administration tasks. The other options are valid mitigation strategies.
Which of the following is a potential indicator of malicious Systemd service activity?,A suspicious process with a parent process of "systemd" and a parent process ID of 1,A newly created systemd service that runs as a non-privileged user,A .service file that references a legitimate executable,An empty systemd service unit file,A,A suspicious process with a parent process of "systemd" and a parent process ID of 1 is a strong indicator of a process spawned by a systemd service, potentially malicious.
Which of the following statements regarding the "User" directive in a .service file is TRUE?,It specifies the user account under which the service should be executed,It defines the user permissions required for the service to operate,It controls access to the service's configuration files,It determines the priority level of the service,A,The "User" directive in a .service file explicitly specifies the user account under which the service should execute, potentially allowing attackers to elevate privileges.
Which of the following is NOT a potential source of information for building a baseline of legitimate Systemd service configurations?,Analyzing the systemd service unit files on a trusted system,Monitoring for new systemd services created by legitimate applications,Reviewing security logs for suspicious systemd service activity,Consulting the vendor documentation for the operating system,C,While monitoring security logs is crucial, it primarily focuses on identifying suspicious activity rather than providing a baseline of legitimate configurations. The other options are valid sources for establishing a baseline.
