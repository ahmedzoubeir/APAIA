Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is the primary function of application shims in Windows?,,To provide backward compatibility for older software,,To enforce strict security policies on applications,,To monitor and control application execution,,To accelerate application loading times,,A,Application shims are designed to ensure that older applications function correctly on newer versions of Windows.
How can an attacker exploit application shims to gain persistence?,,By creating custom shim databases to redirect program execution,,By modifying the default shim database (sdbinst.exe) to execute malicious code,,By using shim flags to bypass UAC and inject malicious DLLs into processes,,All of the above,,D,Attackers can leverage shims for persistence by creating custom databases, modifying the default database, and using shim flags to bypass security measures.
What MITRE ATT&CK technique is associated with the use of application shims to bypass UAC?,,T1548.004 - Bypass User Account Control,,T1055.003 - Process Injection,,T1087 - Account Manipulation,,T1550.003 - Hijack Execution Flow,,A,T1548.004 specifically describes the use of techniques like application shims to bypass User Account Control.
Which of the following is NOT a recommended mitigation strategy for application shim abuse?,,Regularly update Windows with security patches,,Implement a strong password policy for administrator accounts,,Disable the "auto-elevate" flag within sdbinst.exe,,Restrict access to the "AppPatch" folder,,B,While a strong password policy is good practice, it does not directly mitigate application shim abuse.
What is a common indicator of potential application shim abuse?,,Observing the execution of sdbinst.exe with unusual arguments,,Detecting changes to the "C:\Windows\SysWOW64\sdbinst.exe" file,,Identifying a new process that loads "user32.dll" with an unknown DLL,,All of the above,,D,All of these actions indicate potential misuse of application shims.
Which of the following tools can help detect the presence of custom shim databases?,,Shim-Process-Scanner,,Shim-Detector-Lite,,ShimScanner,,ShimCacheMem,,B,Shim-Detector-Lite is specifically designed to identify custom shim database installations.
What is the purpose of the "ShimCacheMem" tool?,,To identify shim flags embedded in running processes,,To analyze shim databases for suspicious configurations,,To extract the shim cache from memory after a system reboot,,To monitor registry changes related to shim installations,,C,ShimCacheMem focuses on extracting the shim cache from memory after a system restart.
What is the primary benefit of using the "Always Notify" setting for User Account Control (UAC)?,,It prevents the use of shims to bypass UAC,,It strengthens security by requiring user confirmation for all privilege escalations,,It allows for fine-grained control over specific applications' privilege levels,,It provides a comprehensive audit trail of all privilege escalation requests,,B,While it doesn't completely prevent shim abuse, "Always Notify" increases user awareness and prompts for confirmation for any privilege escalations.
Which of the following is NOT a potential consequence of an attacker exploiting application shims?,,Data exfiltration,,Installation of backdoors,,Elevation of privileges,,Disabling Windows Defender,,D,Shims can be used to elevate privileges, install backdoors, and potentially exfiltrate data. However, directly disabling Windows Defender is not a typical outcome of shim exploitation.
Which of the following is a critical step in mitigating application shim abuse?,,Implementing network segmentation,,Monitoring suspicious activity related to shim installation and execution,,Training users on secure application usage,,Enforcing strong data encryption policies,,B,Closely monitoring activities related to shim installation and execution is vital to detect and prevent malicious use of shims.
