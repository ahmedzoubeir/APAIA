Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is the MITRE ATT&CK technique ID for "Create or Modify System Process"?,T1547.001,T1547,T1543,T1546,B,This is the correct ID for the "Create or Modify System Process" technique.,
What is the primary purpose of enabling "Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules" on Windows 10, as discussed in the document?,To prevent malware from utilizing system vulnerabilities,To limit user access to sensitive files,To restrict unauthorized network connections,To prevent the installation of unsigned drivers,D,The document specifically mentions ASR rules being used to prevent "an application from writing a signed vulnerable driver to the system.",
Which of the following is NOT a recommended mitigation strategy for preventing adversaries from creating or modifying system processes?,Restrict software installation to trusted repositories only,Monitor for changes to files associated with system-level processes,Disable Driver Signature Enforcement,Manage privileged accounts and their permissions,C,The document emphasizes the importance of enabling Driver Signature Enforcement to restrict unsigned drivers, making this the incorrect option.,
Which of the following is NOT a potential indicator of malicious activity related to "Create or Modify System Process"?,New service driver installations,Newly constructed windows registry keys,Changes to system processes not correlated with known software updates,Installation of new software packages,D,While new software packages might introduce new system processes, it's not inherently indicative of malicious activity. Other options represent potential signs of manipulation.,
Which of the following is NOT a recommended detection strategy for "Create or Modify System Process"?,Monitoring for abnormal process call trees from known services,Monitoring for new container deployments,Monitoring for command-line invocation of tools related to service modification,Monitoring for API calls related to user account creation,D,Monitoring for API calls related to user account creation might be relevant for other techniques like privilege escalation but is not directly related to modifying system processes.,
Which of the following platforms is NOT specifically mentioned in the document as being vulnerable to "Create or Modify System Process"?,Windows,Linux,macOS,Android,D,While Android devices can be targeted by malicious actors, the document specifically focuses on Windows, Linux, and macOS for this technique.,
Which of the following best describes the purpose of "Launchd" processes on macOS?,They manage the startup sequence and load user configurations,They are primarily used for user authentication,They are responsible for system updates,They control network traffic and firewall settings,A,Launchd processes are primarily responsible for system startup and managing user settings, as explained in the document.,
Which of the following is a potential defensive strategy for limiting the impact of "Create or Modify System Process" in a containerized environment?,Disabling root access within containers,Enforcing the use of container services in rootless mode,Restricting access to the host system from containers,All of the above,D,All the mentioned strategies contribute to limiting the impact of "Create or Modify System Process" in a containerized environment by reducing the potential for privilege escalation and malicious effects on the host.,
What is a key difference between the "Create or Modify System Process" technique and the "Persistence" tactic?,The former focuses on establishing a presence, while the latter focuses on maintaining it,The former is more applicable to mobile devices, while the latter is more relevant to enterprise systems,The former is a specific action, while the latter is a broader goal,The former is more difficult to detect, while the latter is more easily mitigated,C,The document clarifies that "Create or Modify System Process" is a technique used for persistence, highlighting that the former is a specific action taken to achieve the broader goal of persistence.,
In the context of "Create or Modify System Process," what is the significance of monitoring "Sysmon Event ID 6"?,It indicates suspicious network connections,It signifies the creation of a new service driver,It suggests a change in user account privileges,It logs attempts to access sensitive files,B,The document mentions that Sysmon Event ID 6 specifically relates to new service driver installations and loads.,
