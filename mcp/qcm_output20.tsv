Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What technique does an adversary utilize when enrolling a device to an adversary-controlled account, potentially bypassing MFA requirements and gaining persistent access to a network?,,T1134.003 - Account Manipulation: Device Registration,T1078.002 - Valid Accounts,T1590.001 -  Credential Dumping,T1134.003 - Account Manipulation: Device Registration,C,The question focuses on the technique used to register a device, bypassing MFA. The text clearly describes this as T1134.003 - Account Manipulation: Device Registration.,
What specific platform is primarily discussed in the text regarding device registration for account manipulation purposes?,,Enterprise,ICS,Mobile,None of the above,A,The text focuses on Azure AD and Intune, which are Enterprise platforms used for device management and access control, making it the primary platform discussed. The text also mentions MFA systems like Duo and Okta, which are common in Enterprise environments.,
Which specific mitigation technique is suggested to prevent an adversary from enrolling a device to an inactive account, as described in the text?,,Restricting device enrollment based on location and device trust,Requiring MFA for device registration,Using temporary access passes as an initial MFA solution,All of the above,D,The text recommends using conditional access policies to restrict enrollment to trusted locations/devices, requiring MFA for enrollment, and using temporary passes for initial enrollment. All these are mentioned as mitigation techniques, making D the correct answer.,
Which of the following is NOT a procedure example mentioned in the text showcasing real-world instances of device registration for account manipulation?,,AADInternals registering a device to Azure AD,APT29 enrolling devices into compromised cloud tenants,Scattered Spider registering devices for MFA to maintain persistence,The SolarWinds Compromise involving device registration,C,The text mentions AADInternals, APT29, and the SolarWinds compromise as examples of device registration for account manipulation. Scattered Spider's activities are not mentioned in the context of device registration in this section.,
Which MITRE ATT&CK technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in MFA systems to bypass security controls and gain unauthorized access?,,T1134.003 - Account Manipulation: Device Registration,T1590.001 - Credential Dumping,T1550.003 -  Bypass Authentication: MFA/2FA,T1078.002 - Valid Accounts,C,T1550.003 specifically addresses bypassing MFA/2FA. The text focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities within MFA systems, making this the relevant technique.,
According to the text, what type of email campaign might be conducted by an adversary who registers a device to Azure AD?,,External phishing,Spearphishing,Watering hole,Whaling,B,The text states that devices registered in Azure AD can conduct "Internal Spearphishing campaigns via intra-organizational emails," emphasizing the targeted nature of these attacks within an organization.,
Which of the following is NOT a log entry or resource mentioned in the text that can be monitored for detecting unexpected device registrations in Azure AD?,,Azure AD logs related to new device enrollment,Active Directory device objects,Microsoft Intune device records,User account activity logs,D,While user account activity logs can be helpful for monitoring suspicious actions, they are not explicitly mentioned in the text as a resource for detecting device registrations.,
What is a potential consequence of an adversary performing a "Service Exhaustion Flood" on an Azure AD tenant by registering numerous devices?,,Denial of service,Data exfiltration,Privilege escalation,Lateral movement,A,The text mentions that an adversary can perform a "Service Exhaustion Flood" on Azure AD, which typically leads to a denial of service condition by overwhelming the system with requests.,
What security measure is suggested to mitigate the risk of an adversary registering devices in Azure AD for malicious purposes, as mentioned in the text?,,Enforce MFA for device registration,Implement network segmentation,Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR),Use data loss prevention (DLP) solutions,A,The text explicitly recommends requiring MFA for device registration in Azure AD to mitigate the risk of malicious device enrollment.,
Which of the following scenarios is NOT directly related to the concept of device registration as discussed in the text?,,An adversary gaining access to a user's email account and registering a new device for MFA to bypass account security,An attacker obtaining credentials through phishing and using them to register a device for accessing sensitive data,A malicious actor exploiting a vulnerability in Azure AD to gain unauthorized access to devices registered in the platform,An attacker injecting malware into a user's device to gain remote access and control over the system,D,The text focuses on device registration for MFA bypassing and accessing network resources. Option D involves malware injection, which is a separate attack vector and not directly related to device registration within the context provided.,
