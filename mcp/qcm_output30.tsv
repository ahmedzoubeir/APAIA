Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What MITRE ATT&CK technique is described in the text, targeting the LSA Subsystem Service (LSASS) for persistence?,,T1057.002 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: LSASS Driver,T1053.003 - Hijack Execution Flow,T1562 -  Valid Accounts,,T1057.002 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: LSASS Driver,D,This technique specifically targets the LSASS driver to obtain persistence by modifying or adding drivers, as described in the text.
Which of these is NOT a mitigation strategy for protecting LSASS from malicious drivers?,,Enabling Windows Defender Credential Guard on supported systems,Enforcing LSA Protection with the appropriate registry key,Enabling Safe DLL search mode,Enabling User Account Control (UAC),,D,UAC (User Account Control) primarily focuses on user account permissions and prompts for elevation, not directly related to LSASS driver protection. The other options are specifically mentioned as mitigation strategies in the text.
Which procedure examples are discussed in the text, demonstrating adversary tactics for exploiting LSASS drivers?,,Pasam and Wingbird,Wingbird and Ghost,APT1 and APT3,Pasam and APT3,,A,The text mentions Pasam and Wingbird as examples of adversaries using techniques to load malicious DLLs as drivers within the LSASS environment.
Which event logs should be monitored to detect failed attempts to load LSA plug-ins and drivers, specifically with LSA Protection enabled?,,Event IDs 3033 and 3063,Event IDs 4624 and 4625,Event IDs 4771 and 4776,Event IDs 5140 and 5145,,A,The text explicitly mentions event IDs 3033 and 3063 as indicators for monitoring failed LSA plug-in and driver loading attempts when LSA Protection is enabled.
What is the primary purpose of enabling Safe DLL search mode (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\SafeDllSearchMode)?,,To prevent lsass.exe from loading malicious code libraries,To limit the number of users who can access the LSASS process,To protect the integrity of the LSASS drivers,To enforce password complexity requirements for LSASS access,,A,Safe DLL search mode is designed to restrict where lsass.exe can load DLLs from, preventing potential malicious code libraries from being loaded into the LSASS process.
What MITRE ATT&CK tactic does this technique (T1057.002) belong to?,,Persistence,Discovery,Execution,Credential Access,,A,The technique focuses on gaining persistent access to a system by modifying or adding LSASS drivers, making it a persistence tactic.
Which of the following is a Sysinternals utility mentioned in the text for examining loaded drivers associated with LSA?,,Process Explorer,Autoruns/Autorunsc,FileMon,RegShot,,B,The text specifically recommends using the Sysinternals Autoruns/Autorunsc utility to analyze loaded drivers associated with the LSA.
According to the text, what is the main component responsible for local security policy and user authentication within Windows?,,Local Security Authority (LSA),Security Accounts Manager (SAM),Windows Security Subsystem,Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL),,A,The text states that the Local Security Authority (LSA) is the primary component for managing local security policy and user authentication within Windows.
Which of the following statements accurately describes the action of Windows Defender Credential Guard when enabled?,,It creates a virtualized environment for lsass.exe to run without any device drivers,It monitors for suspicious activity related to LSASS drivers,It enforces password complexity requirements for LSASS access,It restricts the number of users who can access the LSASS process,,A,Windows Defender Credential Guard creates an isolated virtual environment for lsass.exe, eliminating the possibility of malicious drivers directly targeting it.
Which of the following is NOT a way to detect potential threats targeting LSASS drivers?,,Monitoring DLL load operations in lsass.exe,Monitoring for changes made to files associated with LSASS drivers,Monitoring network traffic for unusual activity,Monitoring for newly constructed files related to LSASS drivers,,C,While network traffic monitoring is essential for cybersecurity, it's not explicitly mentioned in the text as a method to detect threats specifically targeting LSASS drivers. The other options are directly related to monitoring LSASS driver-related activity.
