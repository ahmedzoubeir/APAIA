Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
What is the primary purpose of Launch Daemons on macOS?,,To provide access to shared resources, updates to software, or conduct automation tasks.,To facilitate user login and authentication.,To manage system-level processes and resources.,To monitor network traffic and detect malicious activity.,A,Launch Daemons are used to provide access to shared resources, updates to software, or conduct automation tasks, as stated in the text.
Which of the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques is MOST relevant to the creation of a malicious Launch Daemon?,T1543.003: Create or Modify System Process: Launch Daemon,T1546.002: Create Account: Local,T1055.001: Process Injection,T1070.004: Indicator Removal from Tools,A,The text explicitly describes the creation of malicious Launch Daemons as a method of persistence, aligning with the T1543.003: Create or Modify System Process: Launch Daemon technique.
What is a potential security vulnerability related to Launch Daemons?,,Malicious Launch Daemons can be created and executed with administrative privileges.,Launch Daemons can be used to bypass system controls and elevate privileges.,Launch Daemons can be used to monitor and steal user data.,All of the above.,D,The text states that Launch Daemons run with administrative privileges and that poor configurations can allow adversaries to modify executables referenced by Launch Daemons. This indicates that Launch Daemons are vulnerable to both malicious creation and manipulation, leading to privilege escalation and potential data theft.
Which of the following is NOT a recommended mitigation strategy for addressing the security risks associated with Launch Daemons?,,Regularly audit folder permissions and changes made by third-party software.,Restrict user account privileges to prevent unauthorized creation of Launch Daemons.,Monitor for new files added to the /Library/LaunchDaemons/ folder.,Disable all Launch Daemons to prevent any potential exploitation.,D,Disabling all Launch Daemons is not a feasible mitigation strategy as it would disrupt essential system functions. Instead, the focus should be on identifying and mitigating the risks associated with specific Launch Daemons.
How can defenders identify potentially malicious Launch Daemons?,By monitoring for new files added to the /Library/LaunchDaemons/ folder.,By analyzing the Program parameter of Launch Daemons to ensure it points to signed code.,By examining the RunAtLoad parameter and ensuring it is set to true only for trusted Launch Daemons.,By examining the Launch Daemon's plist file and ensuring it does not contain any suspicious entries.,All of the above.,E,All the mentioned methods are effective for identifying potentially malicious Launch Daemons. Monitoring for new files, analyzing the Program and RunAtLoad parameters, and examining the plist file for suspicious entries contribute to a comprehensive detection strategy.
What is the significance of the "RunAtLoad" parameter in a Launch Daemon's plist file?,It specifies the name of the executable program to be launched.,It determines the frequency of the Launch Daemon's execution.,It defines the user account under which the Launch Daemon will run.,It specifies whether the Launch Daemon should be executed at startup.,D,The "RunAtLoad" parameter in a Launch Daemon's plist file determines whether the Launch Daemon should be executed at startup. If set to "true," the Launch Daemon will execute immediately upon system initialization.
What is the primary function of the "Program" parameter in a Launch Daemon's plist file?,,It defines the user account under which the Launch Daemon will run.,It specifies the frequency of the Launch Daemon's execution.,It specifies the path to the executable file to be launched.,It defines the name of the Launch Daemon.,C,The "Program" parameter in a Launch Daemon's plist file specifies the path to the executable file that will be launched when the Launch Daemon is executed. This parameter is crucial for determining the program's execution.
Which of the following tools or techniques can be used to detect suspicious changes to Launch Daemons on a macOS system?,File integrity monitoring tools,Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions,Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions,All of the above.,D,All the mentioned tools and techniques can be used to detect suspicious changes to Launch Daemons on a macOS system. File integrity monitoring tools track file modifications, SIEM solutions aggregate and analyze security events, and EDR solutions provide real-time monitoring and response capabilities.
Which of the following best describes the type of security control that limits the privileges of user accounts?,,Administrative control,Physical control,Technical control,Logical control.,C,Limiting user account privileges is a technical control. Technical controls are implemented using technology to reduce or mitigate cybersecurity risks. This includes access control mechanisms, encryption, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.
In the context of Launch Daemons, what is the significance of the System Integrity Protection (SIP) feature in macOS?,,SIP prevents unauthorized access to critical system files, including Launch Daemons in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/.,SIP automatically removes any malicious Launch Daemons from the system.,SIP encrypts all Launch Daemons to prevent unauthorized access.,SIP restricts the use of Launch Daemons to only authorized users.,A,SIP (System Integrity Protection) is a macOS security feature that protects critical system files, including Launch Daemons located in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/. This prevents unauthorized modification or removal of these essential system components.
