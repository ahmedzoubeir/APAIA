https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23452,"Request smuggling vulnerability in HTTP server in Apache bRPC 0.9.5~1.7.0 on all platforms allows attacker to smuggle request.

Vulnerability Cause Description：

The http_parser does not comply with the RFC-7230 HTTP 1.1 specification.

Attack scenario:
If a message is received with both a Transfer-Encoding and a Content-Length header field, such a message might indicate an attempt to perform request smuggling or response splitting.
One particular attack scenario is that a bRPC made http server on the backend receiving requests in one persistent connection from frontend server that uses TE to parse request with the logic that 'chunk' is contained in the TE field. in that case an attacker can smuggle a request into the connection to the backend server. 

Solution:
You can choose one solution from below:
1. Upgrade bRPC to version 1.8.0, which fixes this issue. Download link:  https://github.com/apache/brpc/releases/tag/1.8.0
 2. Apply this patch:  https://github.com/apache/brpc/pull/2518",CWE-444,"

        ","**CWE-918: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Web Page (Cross-Site Scripting)**

**Explanation:**

While the description mentions ""request smuggling,"" the root cause lies in the server's failure to properly handle HTTP headers according to RFC-7230. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code or manipulate the server's behavior through the ""Transfer-Encoding"" and ""Content-Length"" headers.  This scenario aligns with CWE-918, where the application doesn't correctly neutralize special elements within HTTP headers, leading to potential cross-site scripting vulnerabilities."

In `trillium-http` prior to 0.3.12 and `trillium-client` prior to 0.5.4, insufficient validation of outbound header values may lead to request splitting or response splitting attacks in scenarios where attackers have sufficient control over headers. This only affects use cases where attackers have control of request headers, and can insert ""\r\n"" sequences. Specifically, if untrusted and unvalidated input is inserted into header names or values.

Outbound `trillium_http::HeaderValue` and `trillium_http::HeaderName` can be constructed infallibly and were not checked for illegal bytes when sending requests from the client or responses from the server. Thus, if an attacker has sufficient control over header values (or names) in a request or response that they could inject `\r\n` sequences, they could get the client and server out of sync, and then pivot to gain control over other parts of requests or responses.

The malicious webpage can connect to the Devtools WebSocket, perform a directory traversal brute force to find the authentication token, then use the *authenticated* `writeStaticAssets` function to create a new Component, Nitro Handler or `app.vue` file which will run automatically as the file is changed. This vulnerability has been addressed in release version 1.3.9. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

        copy_params in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c in the Linux kernel through 6.7.1 can attempt to allocate more than INT_MAX bytes, and crash, because of a missing param_kernel->data_size check. This is related to ctl_ioctl.
        ","CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write 

**Explanation:** This vulnerability arises from the potential for `copy_params` to attempt to allocate more than `INT_MAX` bytes, which can lead to an out-of-bounds write and a system crash. The missing `param_kernel->data_size` check allows this condition to occur.  CWE-787 accurately describes this scenario where the code attempts to write data outside of the allocated memory boundaries."

        Jenkins Red Hat Dependency Analytics Plugin 0.7.1 and earlier programmatically disables Content-Security-Policy protection for user-generated content in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc. that Jenkins offers for download.
        ","CWE-616: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer

**Explanation:**

The vulnerability description states that the Jenkins Red Hat Dependency Analytics Plugin disables the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) protection for user-generated content.  This means the plugin allows user input to be rendered without proper sanitization or filtering, which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

CWE-616 covers vulnerabilities where applications fail to adequately restrict operations within the bounds of a memory buffer, often leading to buffer overflows or other memory corruption vulnerabilities.  While CSP is not directly related to memory buffers, the plugin's failure to enforce the CSP is akin to allowing potentially malicious user input to ""overflow"" the boundaries of expected content, leading to similar risks. 

While there might be other applicable CWEs (e.g., CWE-79 for XSS), CWE-616 is the most relevant in this case due to the plugin's failure to restrict operations within the bounds of expected security measures."

        ","CWE-835: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Dynamically Evaluated Expression

**Explanation:** The vulnerability involves a flaw in the parsing of user-supplied input (the rev spec string) that leads to the creation of an infinite loop. This is a classic example of improper input validation and sanitization, where the application fails to adequately handle special elements within the input, resulting in unexpected behavior and potentially a Denial of Service (DoS) attack."
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24576,"Rust is a programming language. The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the Rust standard library prior to version 1.77.2 did not properly escape arguments when invoking batch files (with the `bat` and `cmd` extensions) on Windows using the `Command`. An attacker able to control the arguments passed to the spawned process could execute arbitrary shell commands by bypassing the escaping. The severity of this vulnerability is critical for those who invoke batch files on Windows with untrusted arguments. No other platform or use is affected.

The `Command::arg` and `Command::args` APIs state in their documentation that the arguments will be passed to the spawned process as-is, regardless of the content of the arguments, and will not be evaluated by a shell. This means it should be safe to pass untrusted input as an argument.

On Windows, the implementation of this is more complex than other platforms, because the Windows API only provides a single string containing all the arguments to the spawned process, and it's up to the spawned process to split them. Most programs use the standard C run-time argv, which in practice results in a mostly consistent way arguments are splitted.

One exception though is `cmd.exe` (used among other things to execute batch files), which has its own argument splitting logic. That forces the standard library to implement custom escaping for arguments passed to batch files. Unfortunately it was reported that our escaping logic was not thorough enough, and it was possible to pass malicious arguments that would result in arbitrary shell execution.

Due to the complexity of `cmd.exe`, we didn't identify a solution that would correctly escape arguments in all cases. To maintain our API guarantees, we improved the robustness of the escaping code, and changed the `Command` API to return an `InvalidInput` error when it cannot safely escape an argument. This error will be emitted when spawning the process.

The fix is included in Rust 1.77.2. Note that the new escaping logic for batch files errs on the conservative side, and could reject valid arguments. Those who implement the escaping themselves or only handle trusted inputs on Windows can also use the `CommandExt::raw_arg` method to bypass the standard library's escaping logic.",CWE-88,"

We can see above that at [0] a stack-based buffer called `comment` is defined with an hardcoded size of `1000 bytes`.  The call to `fscanf` at [1] is unsafe and if the first line of the header of the `.off` files is longer than 1000 bytes it will overflow the `header` buffer.
        ","**CWE-120: Buffer Overflow**

**Explanation:** The vulnerability description clearly states that a stack-based buffer overflow occurs when the input from the `.off` file exceeds the allocated size of the `comment` buffer. This directly aligns with CWE-120, which defines the category of vulnerabilities where code writes beyond the bounds of a buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations and causing unexpected behavior."

Versions prior to 2.2.9, 2.3.7, 2.4.5, and 2.5.2 contain a non-exploitable multi-factor authentication weakness. Superusers who have their credentials (username + password) compromised could potentially have the second-factor authentication bypassed if an attacker somehow managed to authenticate to Open Forms. The maintainers of Open Forms do not believe it is or has been possible to perform this login. However, if this were possible, the victim's account may be abused to view (potentially sensitive) submission data or have been used to impersonate other staff accounts to view and/or modify data. Three mitigating factors to help prevent exploitation include: the usual login page (at `/admin/login/`) does not fully log in the user until the second factor was succesfully provided; the additional non-MFA protected login page at `/api/v2/api-authlogin/` was misconfigured and could not be used to log in; and there are no additional ways to log in. This also requires credentials of a superuser to be compromised to be exploitable.

Prior to version 2.16.3, an XML parser used by the CodeQL CLI to read various auxiliary files is vulnerable to an XML External Entity attack. If a vulnerable version of the CLI is used to process either a maliciously modified CodeQL database, or a specially prepared set of QL query sources, the CLI can be made to make an outgoing HTTP request to an URL that contains material read from a local file chosen by the attacker. This may result in a loss of privacy of exfiltration of secrets. Security researchers and QL authors who receive databases or QL source files from untrusted sources may be impacted. A single untrusted `.ql` or `.qll` file cannot be affected, but a zip archive or tarball containing QL sources may unpack auxiliary files that will trigger an attack when CodeQL sees them in the file system. Those using CodeQL for routine analysis of source trees with a preselected set of trusted queries are not affected. In particular, extracting XML files from a source tree into the CodeQL database does not make one vulnerable. The problem is fixed in release 2.16.3 of the CodeQL CLI. Other than upgrading, workarounds include not accepting CodeQL databases or queries from untrusted sources, or only processing such material on a machine without an Internet connection. Customers who use older releases of CodeQL for security scanning in an automated CI system and cannot upgrade for compliance reasons can continue using that version. That use case is safe. If such customers have a private query pack and use the `codeql pack create` command to precompile them before using them in the CI system, they should be using the production CodeQL release to run `codeql pack create`.

When a user logs in through an external authentication provider for the first time, Mastodon checks the e-mail address passed by the provider to find an existing account. However, using the e-mail address alone means that if the authentication provider allows changing the e-mail address of an account, the Mastodon account can immediately be hijacked. All users logging in through external authentication providers are affected. The severity is medium, as it also requires the external authentication provider to misbehave.

When an OAuth Application is destroyed, the streaming server wasn't being informed that the Access Tokens had also been destroyed, this could have posed security risks to users by allowing an application to continue listening to streaming after the application had been destroyed.

mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix stack corruption

When tc filters are first added to a net device, the corresponding local
port gets bound to an ACL group in the device. The group contains a list
of ACLs. In turn, each ACL points to a different TCAM region where the
filters are stored. During forwarding, the ACLs are sequentially
evaluated until a match is found.

One reason to place filters in different regions is when they are added
with decreasing priorities and in an alternating order so that two
consecutive filters can never fit in the same region because of their
key usage.

In Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs the firmware started to report that the
maximum number of ACLs in a group is more than 16, but the layout of the
register that configures ACL groups (PAGT) was not updated to account
for that. It is therefore possible to hit stack corruption [1] in the
rare case where more than 16 ACLs in a group are required.

Fix by limiting the maximum ACL group size to the minimum between what
the firmware reports and the maximum ACLs that fit in the PAGT register.

Add a test case to make sure the machine does not crash when this
condition is hit.

        Description:
        In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: netdevsim: don't try to destroy PHC on VFs

PHC gets initialized in nsim_init_netdevsim(), which
is only called if (nsim_dev_port_is_pf()).

Create a counterpart of nsim_init_netdevsim() and
move the mock_phc_destroy() there.

This fixes a crash trying to destroy netdevsim with
VFs instantiated, as caught by running the devlink.sh test:

bpf: Reject variable offset alu on PTR_TO_FLOW_KEYS

For PTR_TO_FLOW_KEYS, check_flow_keys_access() only uses fixed off
for validation. However, variable offset ptr alu is not prohibited
for this ptr kind. So the variable offset is not checked.

The following prog is accepted:

  0: (bf) r6 = r1                       ; R1=ctx() R6_w=ctx()

This prog loads flow_keys to r7, and adds the variable offset r8

        Description:
        In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Reject variable offset alu on PTR_TO_FLOW_KEYS

For PTR_TO_FLOW_KEYS, check_flow_keys_access() only uses fixed off
for validation. However, variable offset ptr alu is not prohibited
for this ptr kind. So the variable offset is not checked.

The following prog is accepted:

  func#0 @0
  0: R1=ctx() R10=fp0
  0: (bf) r6 = r1                       ; R1=ctx() R6_w=ctx()
  1: (79) r7 = *(u64 *)(r6 +144)        ; R6_w=ctx() R7_w=flow_keys()
  2: (b7) r8 = 1024                     ; R8_w=1024
  3: (37) r8 /= 1                       ; R8_w=scalar()
  4: (57) r8 &= 1024                    ; R8_w=scalar(smin=smin32=0,
  smax=umax=smax32=umax32=1024,var_off=(0x0; 0x400))
  5: (0f) r7 += r8
  mark_precise: frame0: last_idx 5 first_idx 0 subseq_idx -1
  mark_precise: frame0: regs=r8 stack= before 4: (57) r8 &= 1024
  mark_precise: frame0: regs=r8 stack= before 3: (37) r8 /= 1
  mark_precise: frame0: regs=r8 stack= before 2: (b7) r8 = 1024
  6: R7_w=flow_keys(smin=smin32=0,smax=umax=smax32=umax32=1024,var_off
  =(0x0; 0x400)) R8_w=scalar(smin=smin32=0,smax=umax=smax32=umax32=1024,
  var_off=(0x0; 0x400))
  6: (79) r0 = *(u64 *)(r7 +0)          ; R0_w=scalar()
  7: (95) exit

This prog loads flow_keys to r7, and adds the variable offset r8
to r7, and finally causes out-of-bounds access:

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26606,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binder: signal epoll threads of self-work

In (e)poll mode, threads often depend on I/O events to determine when
data is ready for consumption. Within binder, a thread may initiate a
command via BINDER_WRITE_READ without a read buffer and then make use
of epoll_wait() or similar to consume any responses afterwards.

It is then crucial that epoll threads are signaled via wakeup when they
queue their own work. Otherwise, they risk waiting indefinitely for an

This vulnerability is classified as a race condition because it arises from the timing of events between the binder thread initiating a command and the epoll thread waiting for a response.  The race condition occurs because the epoll thread might wait indefinitely for an event, leaving its work unhandled, if it's not signaled when its own work is queued. This could lead to a denial of service or other security issues."

        Description:
        In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: fix uninitialized dplls mutex usage

The pf->dplls.lock mutex is initialized too late, after its first use.
Move it to the top of ice_dpll_init.
Note that the ""err_exit"" error path destroys the mutex. And the mutex is
the last thing destroyed in ice_dpll_deinit.
This fixes the following warning with CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEXES:

        ","CWE-362:  **Missing Initialization**

This vulnerability occurs because the mutex `pf->dplls.lock` is not initialized before its first use, leading to undefined behavior and potential crashes. The description explicitly mentions that the mutex is initialized ""too late,"" after its first use, indicating a clear instance of missing initialization."
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26864,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: Fix refcnt handling in __inet_hash_connect().

syzbot reported a warning in sk_nulls_del_node_init_rcu().

The commit 66b60b0c8c4a (""dccp/tcp: Unhash sk from ehash for tb2 alloc
failure after check_estalblished()."") tried to fix an issue that an
unconnected socket occupies an ehash entry when bhash2 allocation fails.

In such a case, we need to revert changes done by check_established(),
which does not hold refcnt when inserting socket into ehash.

So, to revert the change, we need to __sk_nulls_add_node_rcu() instead
of sk_nulls_add_node_rcu().

Otherwise, sock_put() will cause refcnt underflow and leak the socket.

        ","CWE-476:  **NULL Pointer Dereference**

The vulnerability description states that the code might cause a reference count underflow and leak a socket if `__sk_nulls_add_node_rcu()` is not used instead of `sk_nulls_add_node_rcu()`. This indicates that a pointer might be dereferenced without proper validation, leading to a null pointer dereference."

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26882,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ip_tunnel: make sure to pull inner header in ip_tunnel_rcv()

Apply the same fix than ones found in :

1ca1ba465e55 (""geneve: make sure to pull inner header in geneve_rx()"")

We have to save skb->network_header in a temporary variable
in order to be able to recompute the network_header pointer
after a pskb_inet_may_pull() call.

pskb_inet_may_pull() makes sure the needed headers are in skb->head.

        In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ip_tunnel: make sure to pull inner header in ip_tunnel_rcv()

Apply the same fix than ones found in :

8d975c15c0cd (""ip6_tunnel: make sure to pull inner header in __ip6_tnl_rcv()"")
1ca1ba465e55 (""geneve: make sure to pull inner header in geneve_rx()"")

We have to save skb->network_header in a temporary variable
in order to be able to recompute the network_header pointer
after a pskb_inet_may_pull() call.

pskb_inet_may_pull() makes sure the needed headers are in skb->head.

The vulnerability description indicates that the code was accessing a pointer (`skb->network_header`) before it was properly initialized. This scenario is a clear case of a Null Pointer Dereference, where the code tries to use a pointer that points to a memory location that has not been allocated or is invalid. The use of `pskb_inet_may_pull()` to ensure that the headers are present in `skb->head` doesn't necessarily guarantee that `skb->network_header` is properly initialized, leading to this vulnerability."

aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts

This patch is against CVE-2023-6270. The description of cve is:

  A flaw was found in the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux
  kernel. The aoecmd_cfg_pkts() function improperly updates the refcnt on
  `struct net_device`, and a use-after-free can be triggered by racing
  between the free on the struct and the access through the `skbtxq`
  global queue. This could lead to a denial of service condition or
  potential code execution.

In aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), it always calls dev_put(ifp) when skb initial
code is finished. But the net_device ifp will still be used in
later tx()->dev_queue_xmit() in kthread. Which means that the
dev_put(ifp) should NOT be called in the success path of skb
initial code in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). Otherwise tx() may run into
use-after-free because the net_device is freed.

This patch removed the dev_put(ifp) in the success path in

aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts

This patch is against CVE-2023-6270. The description of cve is:

  A flaw was found in the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux
  kernel. The aoecmd_cfg_pkts() function improperly updates the refcnt on
  `struct net_device`, and a use-after-free can be triggered by racing
  between the free on the struct and the access through the `skbtxq`
  global queue. This could lead to a denial of service condition or
  potential code execution.

In aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), it always calls dev_put(ifp) when skb initial
code is finished. But the net_device ifp will still be used in
later tx()->dev_queue_xmit() in kthread. Which means that the
dev_put(ifp) should NOT be called in the success path of skb
initial code in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). Otherwise tx() may run into
use-after-free because the net_device is freed.

This patch removed the dev_put(ifp) in the success path in
aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), and added dev_put() after skb xmit in tx().

block: fix deadlock between bd_link_disk_holder and partition scan

'open_mutex' of gendisk is used to protect open/close block devices. But
in bd_link_disk_holder(), it is used to protect the creation of symlink
between holding disk and slave bdev, which introduces some issues.

When bd_link_disk_holder() is called, the driver is usually in the process
of initialization/modification and may suspend submitting io. At this
time, any io hold 'open_mutex', such as scanning partitions, can cause
deadlocks. For example, in raid:

T1                              T2
bdev_open_by_dev
 lock open_mutex [1]

triggered a KASAN report. We analyzed the cause of this bug as follows:

1. In the packets captured during a normal connection, the host sends a
`Read Encryption Key Size` type of `HCI_CMD` packet
(Command Opcode: 0x1408) to the controller to inquire the length of
encryption key.After receiving this packet, the controller immediately
replies with a Command Completepacket (Event Code: 0x0e) to return the
Encryption Key Size.

2. In our fuzz test case, the timing of the controller's response to this
packet was delayed to an unexpected point: after the RFCOMM and L2CAP
layers had disconnected but before the HCI layer had disconnected.

3. After receiving the Encryption Key Size Response at the time described
in point 2, the host still called the rfcomm_check_security function.
However, by this time `struct l2cap_conn *conn = l2cap_pi(sk)->chan->conn;`
had already been released, and when the function executed
`return hci_conn_security(conn->hcon, d->sec_level, auth_type, d->out);`,
specifically when accessing `conn->hcon`, a null-ptr-deref error occurred.

soc: qcom: pmic_glink_altmode: fix drm bridge use-after-free

A recent DRM series purporting to simplify support for ""transparent
bridges"" and handling of probe deferrals ironically exposed a
use-after-free issue on pmic_glink_altmode probe deferral.

This has manifested itself as the display subsystem occasionally failing
to initialise and NULL-pointer dereferences during boot of machines like
the Lenovo ThinkPad X13s.

Specifically, the dp-hpd bridge is currently registered before all
resources have been acquired which means that it can also be
deregistered on probe deferrals.

In the meantime there is a race window where the new aux bridge driver
(or PHY driver previously) may have looked up the dp-hpd bridge and
stored a (non-reference-counted) pointer to the bridge which is about to
be deallocated.

When the display controller is later initialised, this triggers a
use-after-free when attaching the bridges:

	dp -> aux -> dp-hpd (freed)

which may, for example, result in the freed bridge failing to attach:

	[drm:drm_bridge_attach [drm]] *ERROR* failed to attach bridge /soc@0/phy@88eb000 to encoder TMDS-31: -16

or a NULL-pointer dereference:

	Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000

	  dp_bridge_init+0xa8/0x15c [msm]
	  msm_dp_modeset_init+0x28/0xc4 [msm]

The DRM bridge implementation is clearly fragile and implicitly built on
the assumption that bridges may never go away. In this case, the fix is
to move the bridge registration in the pmic_glink_altmode driver to
after all resources have been looked up.

Incidentally, with the new dp-hpd bridge implementation, which registers
child devices, this is also a requirement due to a long-standing issue
in driver core that can otherwise lead to a probe deferral loop (see
commit fbc35b45f9f6 (""Add documentation on meaning of -EPROBE_DEFER"")).

        ","CWE-390: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release

**Explanation:** The vulnerability occurs due to incorrect error handling in the `alloc_range()` function. Instead of returning an appropriate error code (`-ENOSPC`) when the requested memory range cannot be allocated, the function incorrectly returns `SUCCESS`, leading to potential display corruption. This misbehavior falls under CWE-390, as the function fails to properly release or shut down resources (in this case, memory allocation) when an error occurs, leading to unexpected behavior and potential security issues."

  1) nft_pipapo_remove() removes element 0000000X
  Then, KASAN shows a splat.

Looking at the remove function there is a chance that we will drop a
rule that maps to a non-deactivated element.

Removal happens in two steps, first we do a lookup for key k and return the
to-be-removed element and mark it as inactive in the next generation.
Then, in a second step, the element gets removed from the set/map.

The _remove function does not work correctly if we have more than one
element that share the same key.

This can happen if we insert an element into a set when the set already
holds an element with same key, but the element mapping to the existing
key has timed out or is not active in the next generation.

In such case its possible that removal will unmap the wrong element.
If this happens, we will leak the non-deactivated element, it becomes
unreachable.

The element that got deactivated (and will be freed later) will
remain reachable in the set data structure, this can result in
a crash when such an element is retrieved during lookup (stale
pointer).

Add a check that the fully matching key does in fact map to the element
that we have marked as inactive in the deactivation step.
If not, we need to continue searching.

USB: core: Fix deadlock in usb_deauthorize_interface()

Among the attribute file callback routines in

calls usb_deauthorize_interface(), which locks the interface's parent
USB device.

The will lead to deadlock if another process already owns that lock
and tries to remove the interface, whether through a configuration
change or because the device has been disconnected.  As part of the
removal procedure, device_del() waits for all ongoing sysfs attribute
callbacks to complete.  But usb_deauthorize_interface() can't complete
until the device lock has been released, and the lock won't be
released until the removal has finished.

The mechanism provided by sysfs to prevent this kind of deadlock is
to use the sysfs_break_active_protection() function, which tells sysfs
not to wait for the attribute callback.

USB: core: Fix deadlock in usb_deauthorize_interface()

Among the attribute file callback routines in
drivers/usb/core/sysfs.c, the interface_authorized_store() function is
the only one which acquires a device lock on an ancestor device: It
calls usb_deauthorize_interface(), which locks the interface's parent
USB device.

The will lead to deadlock if another process already owns that lock
and tries to remove the interface, whether through a configuration
change or because the device has been disconnected.  As part of the
removal procedure, device_del() waits for all ongoing sysfs attribute
callbacks to complete.  But usb_deauthorize_interface() can't complete
until the device lock has been released, and the lock won't be
released until the removal has finished.

The mechanism provided by sysfs to prevent this kind of deadlock is
to use the sysfs_break_active_protection() function, which tells sysfs
not to wait for the attribute callback.

        ","CWE-362:  **Race Condition**

This vulnerability describes a situation where the order of operations can lead to a deadlock. The  `usb_deauthorize_interface()` function acquires a lock on the parent device, but the removal process also requires that lock. If another process tries to remove the interface while the lock is held, a deadlock occurs because both processes are waiting for the other to release the lock. This is a classic example of a race condition, where the outcome of the program depends on the timing of events."

drm/i915/vma: Fix UAF on destroy against retire race

Object debugging tools were sporadically reporting illegal attempts to
free a still active i915 VMA object when parking a GT believed to be idle.

[161.363515] ____intel_wakeref_put_last+0x1f/0x70 [i915]

That has been tracked down to be happening when another thread is
deactivating the VMA inside __active_retire() helper, after the VMA's
active counter has been already decremented to 0, but before deactivation
of the VMA's object is reported to the object debugging tool.

We could prevent from that race by serializing i915_active_fini() with
__active_retire() via ref->tree_lock, but that wouldn't stop the VMA from
being used, e.g. from __i915_vma_retire() called at the end of
__active_retire(), after that VMA has been already freed by a concurrent
i915_vma_destroy() on return from the i915_active_fini().  Then, we should
rather fix the issue at the VMA level, not in i915_active.

Since __i915_vma_parked() is called from __gt_park() on last put of the
GT's wakeref, the issue could be addressed by holding the GT wakeref long
enough for __active_retire() to complete before that wakeref is released
and the GT parked.

I believe the issue was introduced by commit d93939730347 (""drm/i915:
Remove the vma refcount"") which moved a call to i915_active_fini() from
a dropped i915_vma_release(), called on last put of the removed VMA kref,
to i915_vma_parked() processing path called on last put of a GT wakeref.
However, its visibility to the object debugging tool was suppressed by a
bug in i915_active that was fixed two weeks later with commit e92eb246feb9
(""drm/i915/active: Fix missing debug object activation"").

A VMA associated with a request doesn't acquire a GT wakeref by itself.
Instead, it depends on a wakeref held directly by the request's active
intel_context for a GT associated with its VM, and indirectly on that
intel_context's engine wakeref if the engine belongs to the same GT as the
VMA's VM.  Those wakerefs are released asynchronously to VMA deactivation.

Fix the issue by getting a wakeref for the VMA's GT when activating it,
and putting that wakeref only after the VMA is deactivated.  However,
exclude global GTT from that processing path, otherwise the GPU never goes
idle.  Since __i915_vma_retire() may be called from atomic contexts, use
async variant of wakeref put.  Also, to avoid circular locking dependency,
take care of acquiring the wakeref before VM mutex when both are needed.

v7: Add inline comments with justifications for:
    - using untracked variants of intel_gt_pm_get/put() (Nirmoy),
    - using async variant of _put(),
    - not getting the wakeref in case of a global GTT,
    - always getting the first wakeref outside vm->mutex.
v6: Since __i915_vma_active/retire() callbacks are not serialized, storing
    a wakeref tracking handle inside struct i915_vma is not safe, and
    there is no other good place for that.  Use untracked variants of
    intel_gt_pm_get/put_async().

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26960,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: swap: fix race between free_swap_and_cache() and swapoff()

There was previously a theoretical window where swapoff() could run and
teardown a swap_info_struct while a call to free_swap_and_cache() was
running in another thread.  This could cause, amongst other bad
possibilities, swap_page_trans_huge_swapped() (called by
free_swap_and_cache()) to access the freed memory for swap_map.

This is a theoretical problem and I haven't been able to provoke it from a
test case.  But there has been agreement based on code review that this is
possible (see link below).

Fix it by using get_swap_device()/put_swap_device(), which will stall
swapoff().  There was an extra check in _swap_info_get() to confirm that
the swap entry was not free.  This isn't present in get_swap_device()
because it doesn't make sense in general due to the race between getting
the reference and swapoff.  So I've added an equivalent check directly in
free_swap_and_cache().

Details of how to provoke one possible issue (thanks to David Hildenbrand
for deriving this):

--8<-----

__swap_entry_free() might be the last user and result in
""count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE"".

swapoff->try_to_unuse() will stop as soon as soon as si->inuse_pages==0.

So the question is: could someone reclaim the folio and turn
si->inuse_pages==0, before we completed swap_page_trans_huge_swapped().

Imagine the following: 2 MiB folio in the swapcache. Only 2 subpages are
still references by swap entries.

Process 1 still references subpage 0 via swap entry.
Process 2 still references subpage 1 via swap entry.

Process 1 quits. Calls free_swap_and_cache().
-> count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE
[then, preempted in the hypervisor etc.]

Process 2 quits. Calls free_swap_and_cache().
-> count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE

Process 2 goes ahead, passes swap_page_trans_huge_swapped(), and calls
__try_to_reclaim_swap().

put_swap_folio()->free_swap_slot()->swapcache_free_entries()->

If kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue() actually flushes the workqueue,
then there's no need to gift async_pf_execute() a reference because all
invocations of async_pf_execute() will be forced to complete before the
vCPU and its VM are destroyed/freed.  And that in turn fixes the module
unloading bug as __fput() won't do module_put() on the last vCPU reference
until the vCPU has been freed, e.g. if closing the vCPU file also puts the
last reference to the KVM module.

Note that kvm_check_async_pf_completion() may also take the work item off
the completion queue and so also needs to flush the work queue, as the
work will not be seen by kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue().  Waiting
on the workqueue could theoretically delay a vCPU due to waiting for the
work to complete, but that's a very, very small chance, and likely a very
small delay.  kvm_arch_async_page_present_queued() unconditionally makes a
new request, i.e. will effectively delay entering the guest, so the
remaining work is really just:

        trace_kvm_async_pf_completed(addr, cr2_or_gpa);

        __kvm_vcpu_wake_up(vcpu);

        mmput(mm);

and mmput() can't drop the last reference to the page tables if the vCPU is
still alive, i.e. the vCPU won't get stuck tearing down page tables.

Add a helper to do the flushing, specifically to deal with ""wakeup all""
work items, as they aren't actually work items, i.e. are never placed in a
workqueue.  Trying to flush a bogus workqueue entry rightly makes
__flush_work() complain (kudos to whoever added that sanity check).

Adding any sort of useful debug usually makes it go away, so I hand
wrote the function in a line, and debugged the asm.

Every so often pt->memory->ptrs is NULL. This ptrs ptr is set in
the nv50_instobj_acquire called from nvkm_kmap.

If Thread A and Thread B both get to nv50_instobj_acquire around
the same time, and Thread A hits the refcount_set line, and in
lockstep thread B succeeds at refcount_inc_not_zero, there is a
chance the ptrs value won't have been stored since refcount_set
is unordered. Force a memory barrier here, I picked smp_mb, since
we want it on all CPUs and it's write followed by a read.

        ","CWE-362:  **Race Condition** 

This vulnerability arises from a race condition involving locking mechanisms in the Linux kernel.  The description highlights that the `cpu_hotplug_lock` and `pcp_batch_high_lock` can be acquired in an order that leads to a deadlock. This occurs because different CPUs attempt to acquire the locks in a conflicting order, resulting in a scenario where each CPU is waiting for the other to release a lock it needs."
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27012,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: restore set elements when delete set fails

From abort path, nft_mapelem_activate() needs to restore refcounters to
the original state. Currently, it uses the set->ops->walk() to iterate
over these set elements. The existing set iterator skips inactive
elements in the next generation, this does not work from the abort path
to restore the original state since it has to skip active elements
instead (not inactive ones).

This patch moves the check for inactive elements to the set iterator
callback, then it reverses the logic for the .activate case which
needs to skip active elements.

Toggle next generation bit for elements when delete set command is
invoked and call nft_clear() from .activate (abort) path to restore the
next generation bit.

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27014,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Prevent deadlock while disabling aRFS

When disabling aRFS under the `priv->state_lock`, any scheduled
aRFS works are canceled using the `cancel_work_sync` function,
which waits for the work to end if it has already started.
However, while waiting for the work handler, the handler will
try to acquire the `state_lock` which is already acquired.

The worker acquires the lock to delete the rules if the state
is down, which is not the worker's responsibility since
disabling aRFS deletes the rules.

Add an aRFS state variable, which indicates whether the aRFS is
enabled and prevent adding rules when the aRFS is disabled.

        Description:
        In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Prevent deadlock while disabling aRFS

When disabling aRFS under the `priv->state_lock`, any scheduled
aRFS works are canceled using the `cancel_work_sync` function,
which waits for the work to end if it has already started.
However, while waiting for the work handler, the handler will
try to acquire the `state_lock` which is already acquired.

The worker acquires the lock to delete the rules if the state
is down, which is not the worker's responsibility since
disabling aRFS deletes the rules.

Add an aRFS state variable, which indicates whether the aRFS is
enabled and prevent adding rules when the aRFS is disabled.

        ","CWE-362:  **Race Condition**

This vulnerability arises from a race condition between the bridge input hook and the conntrack module.  The conntrack module assumes that packets received by the bridge input hook are not already associated with a conntrack entry, leading to the creation of duplicate conntrack entries and potential performance degradation. The workaround involves marking the packet as having reached the input hook, preventing unnecessary conntrack processing."
