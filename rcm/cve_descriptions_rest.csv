A critical vulnerability has been identified in the ""/api/{org_id}/users/{email_id}"" endpoint. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user within an organization to remove any other user from that same organization, irrespective of their respective roles. This includes the ability to remove users with ""Admin"" and ""Root"" roles. By enabling any organizational member to unilaterally alter the user base, it opens the door to unauthorized access and can cause considerable disruptions in operations. The core of the vulnerability lies in the `remove_user_from_org` function in the user management system. This function is designed to allow organizational users to remove members from their organization. The function does not check if the user initiating the request has the appropriate administrative privileges to remove a user. Any user who is part of the organization, irrespective of their role, can remove any other user, including those with higher privileges. This vulnerability is categorized as an Authorization issue leading to Unauthorized User Removal. The impact is severe, as it compromises the integrity of user management within organizations. By exploiting this vulnerability, any user within an organization, without the need for administrative privileges, can remove critical users, including ""Admins"" and ""Root"" users. This could result in unauthorized system access, administrative lockout, or operational disruptions.

Libraries using this library as a dependency might be vulnerable to some bypass of restrictions, or even remote code execution, if they do not double check the value of the `fontName` that is passed by php-svg-lib.

mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix stack corruption

When tc filters are first added to a net device, the corresponding local
port gets bound to an ACL group in the device. The group contains a list
of ACLs. In turn, each ACL points to a different TCAM region where the
filters are stored. During forwarding, the ACLs are sequentially
evaluated until a match is found.

One reason to place filters in different regions is when they are added
with decreasing priorities and in an alternating order so that two
consecutive filters can never fit in the same region because of their
key usage.

In Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs the firmware started to report that the
maximum number of ACLs in a group is more than 16, but the layout of the
register that configures ACL groups (PAGT) was not updated to account
for that. It is therefore possible to hit stack corruption [1] in the
rare case where more than 16 ACLs in a group are required.

Fix by limiting the maximum ACL group size to the minimum between what
the firmware reports and the maximum ACLs that fit in the PAGT register.

Add a test case to make sure the machine does not crash when this
condition is hit.

bpf: Reject variable offset alu on PTR_TO_FLOW_KEYS

For PTR_TO_FLOW_KEYS, check_flow_keys_access() only uses fixed off
for validation. However, variable offset ptr alu is not prohibited
for this ptr kind. So the variable offset is not checked.

The following prog is accepted:

net: dsa: fix netdev_priv() dereference before check on non-DSA netdevice events

static inline struct dsa_port *dsa_user_to_port(const struct net_device *dev)

Which is obviously bogus, because not all net_devices have a netdev_priv()
of type struct dsa_user_priv. But struct dsa_user_priv is fairly small,
and p->dp means dereferencing 8 bytes starting with offset 16. Most
drivers allocate that much private memory anyway, making our access not
fault, and we discard the bogus data quickly afterwards, so this wasn't
caught.

But the dummy interface is somewhat special in that it calls
alloc_netdev() with a priv size of 0. So every netdev_priv() dereference
is invalid, and we get this when we emit a NETDEV_PRECHANGEUPPER event

lan966x: Fix crash when adding interface under a lag

There is a crash when adding one of the lan966x interfaces under a lag
interface. The issue can be reproduced like this:
ip link add name bond0 type bond miimon 100 mode balance-xor
ip link set dev eth0 master bond0

The reason is because when adding a interface under the lag it would go
through all the ports and try to figure out which other ports are under
that lag interface. And the issue is that lan966x can have ports that are
NULL pointer as they are not probed. So then iterating over these ports
it would just crash as they are NULL pointers.
The fix consists in actually checking for NULL pointers before accessing
something from the ports. Like we do in other places.",CWE-400,"

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26797,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Prevent potential buffer overflow in map_hw_resources

Adds a check in the map_hw_resources function to prevent a potential
buffer overflow. The function was accessing arrays using an index that
could potentially be greater than the size of the arrays, leading to a
buffer overflow.

Adds a check to ensure that the index is within the bounds of the
arrays. If the index is out of bounds, an error message is printed and
break it will continue execution with just ignoring extra data early to
prevent the buffer overflow.

net/ipv6: avoid possible UAF in ip6_route_mpath_notify()

syzbot found another use-after-free in ip6_route_mpath_notify() [1]

Commit f7225172f25a (""net/ipv6: prevent use after free in
ip6_route_mpath_notify"") was not able to fix the root cause.

We need to defer the fib6_info_release() calls after
ip6_route_mpath_notify(), in the cleanup phase.

        Description:
        In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/ipv6: avoid possible UAF in ip6_route_mpath_notify()

syzbot found another use-after-free in ip6_route_mpath_notify() [1]

Commit f7225172f25a (""net/ipv6: prevent use after free in
ip6_route_mpath_notify"") was not able to fix the root cause.

We need to defer the fib6_info_release() calls after
ip6_route_mpath_notify(), in the cleanup phase.

The commit 66b60b0c8c4a (""dccp/tcp: Unhash sk from ehash for tb2 alloc
failure after check_estalblished()."") tried to fix an issue that an
unconnected socket occupies an ehash entry when bhash2 allocation fails.

In such a case, we need to revert changes done by check_established(),
which does not hold refcnt when inserting socket into ehash.

So, to revert the change, we need to __sk_nulls_add_node_rcu() instead
of sk_nulls_add_node_rcu().

Otherwise, sock_put() will cause refcnt underflow and leak the socket.

net: hns3: fix kernel crash when 1588 is received on HIP08 devices

The HIP08 devices does not register the ptp devices, so the
hdev->ptp is NULL, but the hardware can receive 1588 messages,
and set the HNS3_RXD_TS_VLD_B bit, so, if match this case, the
access of hdev->ptp->flags will cause a kernel crash:

bpf: Fix hashtab overflow check on 32-bit arches

The hashtab code relies on roundup_pow_of_two() to compute the number of
hash buckets, and contains an overflow check by checking if the
resulting value is 0. However, on 32-bit arches, the roundup code itself
can overflow by doing a 32-bit left-shift of an unsigned long value,
which is undefined behaviour, so it is not guaranteed to truncate
neatly. This was triggered by syzbot on the DEVMAP_HASH type, which
contains the same check, copied from the hashtab code. So apply the same
fix to hashtab, by moving the overflow check to before the roundup.

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26885,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix DEVMAP_HASH overflow check on 32-bit arches

The devmap code allocates a number hash buckets equal to the next power
of two of the max_entries value provided when creating the map. When
rounding up to the next power of two, the 32-bit variable storing the
number of buckets can overflow, and the code checks for overflow by
checking if the truncated 32-bit value is equal to 0. However, on 32-bit
arches the rounding up itself can overflow mid-way through, because it
ends up doing a left-shift of 32 bits on an unsigned long value. If the
size of an unsigned long is four bytes, this is undefined behaviour, so
there is no guarantee that we'll end up with a nice and tidy 0-value at
the end.

Syzbot managed to turn this into a crash on arm32 by creating a
DEVMAP_HASH with max_entries > 0x80000000 and then trying to update it.
Fix this by moving the overflow check to before the rounding up
operation.",CWE-119,"

aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts

This patch is against CVE-2023-6270. The description of cve is:

  A flaw was found in the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux
  kernel. The aoecmd_cfg_pkts() function improperly updates the refcnt on
  `struct net_device`, and a use-after-free can be triggered by racing
  between the free on the struct and the access through the `skbtxq`
  global queue. This could lead to a denial of service condition or
  potential code execution.

In aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), it always calls dev_put(ifp) when skb initial
code is finished. But the net_device ifp will still be used in
later tx()->dev_queue_xmit() in kthread. Which means that the
dev_put(ifp) should NOT be called in the success path of skb
initial code in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). Otherwise tx() may run into
use-after-free because the net_device is freed.

Bluetooth: rfcomm: Fix null-ptr-deref in rfcomm_check_security

During our fuzz testing of the connection and disconnection process at the
RFCOMM layer, we discovered this bug. By comparing the packets from a
normal connection and disconnection process with the testcase that
triggered a KASAN report. We analyzed the cause of this bug as follows:

1. In the packets captured during a normal connection, the host sends a
`Read Encryption Key Size` type of `HCI_CMD` packet
(Command Opcode: 0x1408) to the controller to inquire the length of
encryption key.After receiving this packet, the controller immediately
replies with a Command Completepacket (Event Code: 0x0e) to return the
Encryption Key Size.

2. In our fuzz test case, the timing of the controller's response to this
packet was delayed to an unexpected point: after the RFCOMM and L2CAP
layers had disconnected but before the HCI layer had disconnected.

3. After receiving the Encryption Key Size Response at the time described
in point 2, the host still called the rfcomm_check_security function.
However, by this time `struct l2cap_conn *conn = l2cap_pi(sk)->chan->conn;`
had already been released, and when the function executed
`return hci_conn_security(conn->hcon, d->sec_level, auth_type, d->out);`,
specifically when accessing `conn->hcon`, a null-ptr-deref error occurred.

To fix this bug, check if `sk->sk_state` is BT_CLOSED before calling

soc: qcom: pmic_glink_altmode: fix drm bridge use-after-free

A recent DRM series purporting to simplify support for ""transparent
bridges"" and handling of probe deferrals ironically exposed a
use-after-free issue on pmic_glink_altmode probe deferral.

This has manifested itself as the display subsystem occasionally failing
to initialise and NULL-pointer dereferences during boot of machines like
the Lenovo ThinkPad X13s.

Specifically, the dp-hpd bridge is currently registered before all
resources have been acquired which means that it can also be
deregistered on probe deferrals.

In the meantime there is a race window where the new aux bridge driver
(or PHY driver previously) may have looked up the dp-hpd bridge and
stored a (non-reference-counted) pointer to the bridge which is about to
be deallocated.

When the display controller is later initialised, this triggers a
use-after-free when attaching the bridges:

	dp -> aux -> dp-hpd (freed)

which may, for example, result in the freed bridge failing to attach:

	[drm:drm_bridge_attach [drm]] *ERROR* failed to attach bridge /soc@0/phy@88eb000 to encoder TMDS-31: -16

or a NULL-pointer dereference:

	Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000
	...
	Call trace:
	  drm_bridge_attach+0x70/0x1a8 [drm]

	  dp_bridge_init+0xa8/0x15c [msm]
	  msm_dp_modeset_init+0x28/0xc4 [msm]

The DRM bridge implementation is clearly fragile and implicitly built on
the assumption that bridges may never go away. In this case, the fix is
to move the bridge registration in the pmic_glink_altmode driver to
after all resources have been looked up.

Incidentally, with the new dp-hpd bridge implementation, which registers
child devices, this is also a requirement due to a long-standing issue
in driver core that can otherwise lead to a probe deferral loop (see
commit fbc35b45f9f6 (""Add documentation on meaning of -EPROBE_DEFER"")).

netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: do not free live element

Pablo reports a crash with large batches of elements with a
back-to-back add/remove pattern.  Quoting Pablo:

  add_elem(""00000000"") timeout 100 ms
  ...
  add_elem(""0000000X"") timeout 100 ms
  del_elem(""0000000X"") <---------------- delete one that was just added
  ...
  add_elem(""00005000"") timeout 100 ms

  1) nft_pipapo_remove() removes element 0000000X
  Then, KASAN shows a splat.

Looking at the remove function there is a chance that we will drop a
rule that maps to a non-deactivated element.

Removal happens in two steps, first we do a lookup for key k and return the
to-be-removed element and mark it as inactive in the next generation.
Then, in a second step, the element gets removed from the set/map.

The _remove function does not work correctly if we have more than one
element that share the same key.

This can happen if we insert an element into a set when the set already
holds an element with same key, but the element mapping to the existing
key has timed out or is not active in the next generation.

In such case its possible that removal will unmap the wrong element.
If this happens, we will leak the non-deactivated element, it becomes
unreachable.

The element that got deactivated (and will be freed later) will
remain reachable in the set data structure, this can result in
a crash when such an element is retrieved during lookup (stale
pointer).

Add a check that the fully matching key does in fact map to the element
that we have marked as inactive in the deactivation step.
If not, we need to continue searching.

Add a bug/warn trap at the end of the function as well, the remove
function must not ever be called with an invisible/unreachable/non-existent
element.

USB: core: Fix deadlock in port ""disable"" sysfs attribute

The show and store callback routines for the ""disable"" sysfs attribute
file in port.c acquire the device lock for the port's parent hub
device.  This can cause problems if another process has locked the hub
to remove it or change its configuration:

	Removing the hub or changing its configuration requires the

The will lead to deadlock if another process already owns that lock
and tries to remove the interface, whether through a configuration
change or because the device has been disconnected.  As part of the
removal procedure, device_del() waits for all ongoing sysfs attribute
callbacks to complete.  But usb_deauthorize_interface() can't complete
until the device lock has been released, and the lock won't be
released until the removal has finished.

The mechanism provided by sysfs to prevent this kind of deadlock is
to use the sysfs_break_active_protection() function, which tells sysfs
not to wait for the attribute callback.

USB: core: Fix deadlock in usb_deauthorize_interface()

Among the attribute file callback routines in
drivers/usb/core/sysfs.c, the interface_authorized_store() function is
the only one which acquires a device lock on an ancestor device: It
calls usb_deauthorize_interface(), which locks the interface's parent
USB device.

The will lead to deadlock if another process already owns that lock
and tries to remove the interface, whether through a configuration
change or because the device has been disconnected.  As part of the
removal procedure, device_del() waits for all ongoing sysfs attribute
callbacks to complete.  But usb_deauthorize_interface() can't complete
until the device lock has been released, and the lock won't be

drm/i915/vma: Fix UAF on destroy against retire race

Object debugging tools were sporadically reporting illegal attempts to
free a still active i915 VMA object when parking a GT believed to be idle.

[161.363515] ____intel_wakeref_put_last+0x1f/0x70 [i915]

That has been tracked down to be happening when another thread is
deactivating the VMA inside __active_retire() helper, after the VMA's
active counter has been already decremented to 0, but before deactivation
of the VMA's object is reported to the object debugging tool.

We could prevent from that race by serializing i915_active_fini() with
__active_retire() via ref->tree_lock, but that wouldn't stop the VMA from
being used, e.g. from __i915_vma_retire() called at the end of
__active_retire(), after that VMA has been already freed by a concurrent
i915_vma_destroy() on return from the i915_active_fini().  Then, we should
rather fix the issue at the VMA level, not in i915_active.

Since __i915_vma_parked() is called from __gt_park() on last put of the
GT's wakeref, the issue could be addressed by holding the GT wakeref long
enough for __active_retire() to complete before that wakeref is released
and the GT parked.

I believe the issue was introduced by commit d93939730347 (""drm/i915:
Remove the vma refcount"") which moved a call to i915_active_fini() from
a dropped i915_vma_release(), called on last put of the removed VMA kref,
to i915_vma_parked() processing path called on last put of a GT wakeref.
However, its visibility to the object debugging tool was suppressed by a
bug in i915_active that was fixed two weeks later with commit e92eb246feb9
(""drm/i915/active: Fix missing debug object activation"").

A VMA associated with a request doesn't acquire a GT wakeref by itself.
Instead, it depends on a wakeref held directly by the request's active
intel_context for a GT associated with its VM, and indirectly on that
intel_context's engine wakeref if the engine belongs to the same GT as the
VMA's VM.  Those wakerefs are released asynchronously to VMA deactivation.

Fix the issue by getting a wakeref for the VMA's GT when activating it,
and putting that wakeref only after the VMA is deactivated.  However,
exclude global GTT from that processing path, otherwise the GPU never goes
idle.  Since __i915_vma_retire() may be called from atomic contexts, use
async variant of wakeref put.  Also, to avoid circular locking dependency,
take care of acquiring the wakeref before VM mutex when both are needed.

v7: Add inline comments with justifications for:
    - using untracked variants of intel_gt_pm_get/put() (Nirmoy),
    - using async variant of _put(),
    - not getting the wakeref in case of a global GTT,
    - always getting the first wakeref outside vm->mutex.
v6: Since __i915_vma_active/retire() callbacks are not serialized, storing
    a wakeref tracking handle inside struct i915_vma is not safe, and
    there is no other good place for that.  Use untracked variants of
    intel_gt_pm_get/put_async().

s390/zcrypt: fix reference counting on zcrypt card objects

Tests with hot-plugging crytpo cards on KVM guests with debug
kernel build revealed an use after free for the load field of
the struct zcrypt_card. The reason was an incorrect reference
handling of the zcrypt card object which could lead to a free
of the zcrypt card object while it was still in use.

This is an example of the slab message:

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26960,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: swap: fix race between free_swap_and_cache() and swapoff()

There was previously a theoretical window where swapoff() could run and
teardown a swap_info_struct while a call to free_swap_and_cache() was
running in another thread.  This could cause, amongst other bad
possibilities, swap_page_trans_huge_swapped() (called by
free_swap_and_cache()) to access the freed memory for swap_map.

This is a theoretical problem and I haven't been able to provoke it from a
test case.  But there has been agreement based on code review that this is
possible (see link below).

Fix it by using get_swap_device()/put_swap_device(), which will stall
swapoff().  There was an extra check in _swap_info_get() to confirm that
the swap entry was not free.  This isn't present in get_swap_device()
because it doesn't make sense in general due to the race between getting
the reference and swapoff.  So I've added an equivalent check directly in
free_swap_and_cache().

Details of how to provoke one possible issue (thanks to David Hildenbrand
for deriving this):

--8<-----

__swap_entry_free() might be the last user and result in
""count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE"".

swapoff->try_to_unuse() will stop as soon as soon as si->inuse_pages==0.

So the question is: could someone reclaim the folio and turn
si->inuse_pages==0, before we completed swap_page_trans_huge_swapped().

Imagine the following: 2 MiB folio in the swapcache. Only 2 subpages are
still references by swap entries.

Process 1 still references subpage 0 via swap entry.
Process 2 still references subpage 1 via swap entry.

Process 1 quits. Calls free_swap_and_cache().
-> count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE
[then, preempted in the hypervisor etc.]

Process 2 quits. Calls free_swap_and_cache().
-> count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE

Process 2 goes ahead, passes swap_page_trans_huge_swapped(), and calls
__try_to_reclaim_swap().

__try_to_reclaim_swap()->folio_free_swap()->delete_from_swap_cache()->
put_swap_folio()->free_swap_slot()->swapcache_free_entries()->
swap_entry_free()->swap_range_free()->
...
WRITE_ONCE(si->inuse_pages, si->inuse_pages - nr_entries);

What stops swapoff to succeed after process 2 reclaimed the swap cache
but before process1 finished its call to swap_page_trans_huge_swapped()?

KVM: Always flush async #PF workqueue when vCPU is being destroyed

Always flush the per-vCPU async #PF workqueue when a vCPU is clearing its
completion queue, e.g. when a VM and all its vCPUs is being destroyed.
KVM must ensure that none of its workqueue callbacks is running when the
last reference to the KVM _module_ is put.  Gifting a reference to the
associated VM prevents the workqueue callback from dereferencing freed
vCPU/VM memory, but does not prevent the KVM module from being unloaded
before the callback completes.

Drop the misguided VM refcount gifting, as calling kvm_put_kvm() from
async_pf_execute() if kvm_put_kvm() flushes the async #PF workqueue will

If kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue() actually flushes the workqueue,
then there's no need to gift async_pf_execute() a reference because all
invocations of async_pf_execute() will be forced to complete before the
vCPU and its VM are destroyed/freed.  And that in turn fixes the module
unloading bug as __fput() won't do module_put() on the last vCPU reference
until the vCPU has been freed, e.g. if closing the vCPU file also puts the
last reference to the KVM module.

Note that kvm_check_async_pf_completion() may also take the work item off
the completion queue and so also needs to flush the work queue, as the
work will not be seen by kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue().  Waiting
on the workqueue could theoretically delay a vCPU due to waiting for the
work to complete, but that's a very, very small chance, and likely a very
small delay.  kvm_arch_async_page_present_queued() unconditionally makes a
new request, i.e. will effectively delay entering the guest, so the
remaining work is really just:

        trace_kvm_async_pf_completed(addr, cr2_or_gpa);

        __kvm_vcpu_wake_up(vcpu);

        mmput(mm);

and mmput() can't drop the last reference to the page tables if the vCPU is
still alive, i.e. the vCPU won't get stuck tearing down page tables.

Add a helper to do the flushing, specifically to deal with ""wakeup all""
work items, as they aren't actually work items, i.e. are never placed in a
workqueue.  Trying to flush a bogus workqueue entry rightly makes
__flush_work() complain (kudos to whoever added that sanity check).

        Return only the CWE ID and name. If multiple CWE IDs apply, provide the most relevant one.

        Description:
        In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: Always flush async #PF workqueue when vCPU is being destroyed

Always flush the per-vCPU async #PF workqueue when a vCPU is clearing its
completion queue, e.g. when a VM and all its vCPUs is being destroyed.
KVM must ensure that none of its workqueue callbacks is running when the
last reference to the KVM _module_ is put.  Gifting a reference to the
associated VM prevents the workqueue callback from dereferencing freed
vCPU/VM memory, but does not prevent the KVM module from being unloaded
before the callback completes.

Drop the misguided VM refcount gifting, as calling kvm_put_kvm() from
async_pf_execute() if kvm_put_kvm() flushes the async #PF workqueue will
result in deadlock.  async_pf_execute() can't return until kvm_put_kvm()
finishes, and kvm_put_kvm() can't return until async_pf_execute() finishes:

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27012,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: restore set elements when delete set fails

From abort path, nft_mapelem_activate() needs to restore refcounters to
the original state. Currently, it uses the set->ops->walk() to iterate
over these set elements. The existing set iterator skips inactive
elements in the next generation, this does not work from the abort path
to restore the original state since it has to skip active elements
instead (not inactive ones).

This patch moves the check for inactive elements to the set iterator
callback, then it reverses the logic for the .activate case which
needs to skip active elements.

Toggle next generation bit for elements when delete set command is
invoked and call nft_clear() from .activate (abort) path to restore the

        Description:
        In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: restore set elements when delete set fails

From abort path, nft_mapelem_activate() needs to restore refcounters to
the original state. Currently, it uses the set->ops->walk() to iterate
over these set elements. The existing set iterator skips inactive
elements in the next generation, this does not work from the abort path
to restore the original state since it has to skip active elements
instead (not inactive ones).

This patch moves the check for inactive elements to the set iterator
callback, then it reverses the logic for the .activate case which
needs to skip active elements.

Toggle next generation bit for elements when delete set command is
invoked and call nft_clear() from .activate (abort) path to restore the
next generation bit.

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27014,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Prevent deadlock while disabling aRFS

When disabling aRFS under the `priv->state_lock`, any scheduled
aRFS works are canceled using the `cancel_work_sync` function,
which waits for the work to end if it has already started.
However, while waiting for the work handler, the handler will
try to acquire the `state_lock` which is already acquired.

The worker acquires the lock to delete the rules if the state
is down, which is not the worker's responsibility since
disabling aRFS deletes the rules.

Add an aRFS state variable, which indicates whether the aRFS is
enabled and prevent adding rules when the aRFS is disabled.

        You are a cybersecurity expert. Given the following vulnerability description, identify the appropriate CWE category.
        Return only the CWE ID and name. If multiple CWE IDs apply, provide the most relevant one.

        Description:
        In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Prevent deadlock while disabling aRFS

When disabling aRFS under the `priv->state_lock`, any scheduled
aRFS works are canceled using the `cancel_work_sync` function,
which waits for the work to end if it has already started.
However, while waiting for the work handler, the handler will
try to acquire the `state_lock` which is already acquired.

The worker acquires the lock to delete the rules if the state
is down, which is not the worker's responsibility since
disabling aRFS deletes the rules.

Add an aRFS state variable, which indicates whether the aRFS is
enabled and prevent adding rules when the aRFS is disabled.

If only ALLOW ACLs were configured during the migration, the impact would be limited to availability impact. if DENY ACLs were configured, the impact could include confidentiality and integrity impact depending on the ACLs configured, as the DENY ACLs might be ignored due to this vulnerability during the migration period.

usb: gadget: ncm: Avoid dropping datagrams of properly parsed NTBs

It is observed sometimes when tethering is used over NCM with Windows 11
as host, at some instances, the gadget_giveback has one byte appended at
the end of a proper NTB. When the NTB is parsed, unwrap call looks for
any leftover bytes in SKB provided by u_ether and if there are any pending
bytes, it treats them as a separate NTB and parses it. But in case the
second NTB (as per unwrap call) is faulty/corrupt, all the datagrams that
were parsed properly in the first NTB and saved in rx_list are dropped.

Adding a few custom traces showed the following:

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27894,"The Pulsar Functions Worker includes a capability that permits authenticated users to create functions where the function's implementation is referenced by a URL. The supported URL schemes include ""file"", ""http"", and ""https"". When a function is created using this method, the Functions Worker will retrieve the implementation from the URL provided by the user. However, this feature introduces a vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to any file that the Pulsar Functions Worker process has permissions to read. This includes reading the process environment which potentially includes sensitive information, such as secrets. Furthermore, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to use the Pulsar Functions Worker as a proxy to access the content of remote HTTP and HTTPS endpoint URLs. This could also be used to carry out denial of service attacks.
This vulnerability also applies to the Pulsar Broker when it is configured with ""functionsWorkerEnabled=true"".

This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.4.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.3, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.2, from 3.1.0 to 3.1.2, and 3.2.0.

3.2 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.2.1.

Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions.

The updated versions of Pulsar Functions Worker will, by default, impose restrictions on the creation of functions using URLs. For users who rely on this functionality, the Function Worker configuration provides two configuration keys: ""additionalEnabledConnectorUrlPatterns"" and ""additionalEnabledFunctionsUrlPatterns"". These keys allow users to specify a set of URL patterns that are permitted, enabling the creation of functions using URLs that match the defined patterns.

As this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.

NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27933,"Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime. In version 1.39.0, use of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to premature close of arbitrary file descriptors, allowing standard input to be re-opened as a different resource resulting in permission prompt bypass. Node child_process IPC relies on the JS side to pass the raw IPC file descriptor to `op_node_ipc_pipe()`, which returns a `IpcJsonStreamResource` ID associated with the file descriptor. On closing the resource, the raw file descriptor is closed together.

Use of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to premature close of arbitrary file descriptors. This allow standard input (fd 0) to be closed and re-opened for a different resource, which allows a silent permission prompt bypass. This is exploitable by an attacker controlling the code executed inside a Deno runtime to obtain arbitrary code execution on the host machine regardless of permissions.

This bug is known to be exploitable. There is a working exploit that achieves arbitrary code execution by bypassing prompts from zero permissions, additionally abusing the fact that Cache API lacks filesystem permission checks. The attack can be conducted silently as stderr can also be closed, suppressing all prompt outputs.

Version 1.39.1 fixes the bug.",CWE-863,"

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28236,"Vela is a Pipeline Automation (CI/CD) framework built on Linux container technology written in Golang. Vela pipelines can use variable substitution combined with insensitive fields like `parameters`, `image` and `entrypoint` to inject secrets into a plugin/image and — by using common substitution string manipulation — can bypass log masking and expose secrets without the use of the commands block. This unexpected behavior primarily impacts secrets restricted by the ""no commands"" option. This can lead to unintended use of the secret value, and increased risk of exposing the secret during image execution bypassing log masking. **To exploit this** the pipeline author must be supplying the secrets to a plugin that is designed in such a way that will print those parameters in logs. Plugin parameters are not designed for sensitive values and are often intentionally printed throughout execution for informational/debugging purposes. Parameters should therefore be treated as insensitive. While Vela provides secrets masking, secrets exposure is not entirely solved by the masking process. A docker image (plugin) can easily expose secrets if they are not handled properly, or altered in some way. There is a responsibility on the end-user to understand how values injected into a plugin are used. This is a risk that exists for many CICD systems (like GitHub Actions) that handle sensitive runtime variables. Rather, the greater risk is that users who restrict a secret to the ""no commands"" option and use image restriction can still have their secret value exposed via substitution tinkering, which turns the image and command restrictions into a false sense of security. This issue has been addressed in version 0.23.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not provide sensitive values to plugins that can potentially expose them, especially in `parameters` that are not intended to be used for sensitive values, ensure plugins (especially those that utilize shared secrets) follow best practices to avoid logging parameters that are expected to be sensitive, minimize secrets with `pull_request` events enabled, as this allows users to change pipeline configurations and pull in secrets to steps not typically part of the CI process, make use of the build approval setting, restricting builds from untrusted users, and limit use of shared secrets, as they are less restrictive to access by nature.",CWE-532,"

When updating from a file which contains non-domain lines, 5 of the non-domain lines are printed on the screen, so if you provide it with any file on the server which contains non-domain lines it will print them on the screen. This vulnerability is fixed by 5.18.

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28864,"SecureProps is a PHP library designed to simplify the encryption and decryption of property data in objects. A vulnerability in SecureProps version 1.2.0 and 1.2.1 involves a regex failing to detect tags during decryption of encrypted data. This occurs when the encrypted data has been encoded with `NullEncoder` and passed to `TagAwareCipher`, and contains special characters such as `\n`. As a result, the decryption process is skipped since the tags are not detected. This causes the encrypted data to be returned in plain format.  The vulnerability affects users who implement `TagAwareCipher` with any base cipher that has `NullEncoder` (not default). The patch for the issue has been released. Users are advised to update to version 1.2.2. As a workaround, one may use the default `Base64Encoder` with the base cipher decorated with `TagAwareCipher` to prevent special characters in the encrypted string from interfering with regex tag detection logic.  This workaround is safe but may involve double encoding since `TagAwareCipher` uses `NullEncoder` by default.",CWE-1333,"

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28866,"GoCD is a continuous delivery server. GoCD versions from 19.4.0 to 23.5.0 (inclusive) are potentially vulnerable to a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability on the loading page displayed while GoCD is starting, via abuse of a `redirect_to` query parameter with inadequate validation.

Attackers could theoretically abuse the query parameter to steal session tokens or other values from the user's browser. In practice exploiting this to perform privileged actions is likely rather difficult to exploit because the target user would need to be triggered to open an attacker-crafted link in the period where the server is starting up (but not completely started), requiring chaining with a separate denial-of-service vulnerability. Additionally, GoCD server restarts invalidate earlier session tokens (i.e GoCD does not support persistent sessions), so a stolen session token would be unusable once the server has completed restart, and executed XSS would be done within a logged-out context.

The issue is fixed in GoCD 24.1.0. As a workaround, it is technically possible in earlier GoCD versions to override the loading page with an earlier version which is not vulnerable, by starting GoCD with the Java system property override as either `-Dloading.page.resource.path=/loading_pages/default.loading.page.html` (simpler early version of loading page without GoCD introduction) or `-Dloading.page.resource.path=/does_not_exist.html` (to display a simple message with no interactivity).",CWE-79,"

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29018,"Moby is an open source container framework that is a key component of Docker Engine, Docker Desktop, and other distributions of container tooling or runtimes. Moby's networking implementation allows for many networks, each with their own IP address range and gateway, to be defined. This feature is frequently referred to as custom networks, as each network can have a different driver, set of parameters and thus behaviors. When creating a network, the `--internal` flag is used to designate a network as _internal_. The `internal` attribute in a docker-compose.yml file may also be used to mark a network _internal_, and other API clients may specify the `internal` parameter as well.

When containers with networking are created, they are assigned unique network interfaces and IP addresses. The host serves as a router for non-internal networks, with a gateway IP that provides SNAT/DNAT to/from container IPs.

Containers on an internal network may communicate between each other, but are precluded from communicating with any networks the host has access to (LAN or WAN) as no default route is configured, and firewall rules are set up to drop all outgoing traffic. Communication with the gateway IP address (and thus appropriately configured host services) is possible, and the host may communicate with any container IP directly.

In addition to configuring the Linux kernel's various networking features to enable container networking, `dockerd` directly provides some services to container networks. Principal among these is serving as a resolver, enabling service discovery, and resolution of names from an upstream resolver.

When a DNS request for a name that does not correspond to a container is received, the request is forwarded to the configured upstream resolver. This request is made from the container's network namespace: the level of access and routing of traffic is the same as if the request was made by the container itself.

As a consequence of this design, containers solely attached to an internal network will be unable to resolve names using the upstream resolver, as the container itself is unable to communicate with that nameserver. Only the names of containers also attached to the internal network are able to be resolved.

Many systems run a local forwarding DNS resolver. As the host and any containers have separate loopback devices, a consequence of the design described above is that containers are unable to resolve names from the host's configured resolver, as they cannot reach these addresses on the host loopback device. To bridge this gap, and to allow containers to properly resolve names even when a local forwarding resolver is used on a loopback address, `dockerd` detects this scenario and instead forward DNS requests from the host namework namespace. The loopback resolver then forwards the requests to its configured upstream resolvers, as expected.

Because `dockerd` forwards DNS requests to the host loopback device, bypassing the container network namespace's normal routing semantics entirely, internal networks can unexpectedly forward DNS requests to an external nameserver. By registering a domain for which they control the authoritative nameservers, an attacker could arrange for a compromised container to exfiltrate data by encoding it in DNS queries that will eventually be answered by their nameservers.

Docker Desktop is not affected, as Docker Desktop always runs an internal resolver on a RFC 1918 address.

Moby releases 26.0.0, 25.0.4, and 23.0.11 are patched to prevent forwarding any DNS requests from internal networks. As a workaround, run containers intended to be solely attached to internal networks with a custom upstream address, which will force all upstream DNS queries to be resolved from the container's network namespace.",CWE-669,"

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29184,"FreeScout is a self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified within the Signature Input Field of the FreeScout Application prior to version 1.8.128. Stored XSS occurs when user input is not properly sanitized and is stored on the server, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed when other users access the affected page. In this case, the Support Agent User can inject malicious scripts into their signature, which will then be executed when viewed by the Administrator.

The application protects users against XSS attacks by enforcing a CSP policy, the CSP Policy is:  `script-src 'self' 'nonce-abcd'  `. The CSP policy only allows the inclusion of JS files that are present on the application server and doesn't allow any inline script or script other than nonce-abcd. The CSP policy was bypassed by uploading a JS file to the server by a POST request to /conversation/upload endpoint. After this, a working XSS payload was crafted by including the uploaded JS file link as the src of the script. This bypassed the CSP policy and XSS attacks became possible.

The impact of this vulnerability is severe as it allows an attacker to compromise the FreeScout Application. By exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker can perform various malicious actions such as forcing the Administrator to execute actions without their knowledge or consent. For instance, the attacker can force the Administrator to add a new administrator controlled by the attacker, thereby giving the attacker full control over the application. Alternatively, the attacker can elevate the privileges of a low-privileged user to Administrator, further compromising the security of the application.

When Bref prior to version 2.1.17 is used with the Event-Driven Function runtime and the handler is a `RequestHandlerInterface`, then the Lambda event is converted to a PSR7 object. During the conversion process, if the request is a MultiPart, each part is parsed. In the parsing process, the `Content-Type` header of each part is read using the `Riverline/multipart-parser` library.

The library, in the `StreamedPart::parseHeaderContent` function, performs slow multi-byte string operations on the header value.
Precisely, the `mb_convert_encoding` function is used with the first (`$string`) and third (`$from_encoding`) parameters read from the header value.

An attacker could send specifically crafted requests which would force the server into performing long operations with a consequent long billed duration.

The attack has the following requirements and limitations: The Lambda should use the Event-Driven Function runtime and the `RequestHandlerInterface` handler and should implement at least an endpoint accepting POST requests; the attacker can send requests up to 6MB long (this is enough to cause a billed duration between 400ms and 500ms with the default 1024MB RAM Lambda image of Bref); and if the Lambda uses a PHP runtime <= php-82, the impact is higher as the billed duration in the default 1024MB RAM Lambda image of Bref could be brought to more than 900ms for each request.

Then, it uses `Object.entries` to iterate over the result whose first item (`name`) gets appended using `innerHTML`. In the event of a victim visiting the server in question, their browser will execute the request against the go2rtc instance. After the request, the browser will be redirected to go2rtc, in which the XSS would be executed in the context of go2rtc’s origin. As of time of publication, no patch is available.

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29209,"A medium severity vulnerability has been identified in the update mechanism of the Phish Alert Button for Outlook, which could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the host machine. The vulnerability arises from the application's failure to securely verify the authenticity and integrity of the update server.

The application periodically checks for updates by querying a specific URL. However, this process does not enforce strict SSL/TLS verification, nor does it validate the digital signature of the received update files. An attacker with the capability to perform DNS spoofing can exploit this weakness. By manipulating DNS responses, the attacker can redirect the application's update requests to a malicious server under their control.

Once the application queries the spoofed update URL, the malicious server can respond with a crafted update package. Since the application fails to properly verify the authenticity of the update file, it will accept and execute the package, leading to arbitrary code execution on the host machine.

Impact:
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute code with elevated privileges, potentially leading to data theft, installation of further malware, or other malicious activities on the host system.

Affected Products:
Phish Alert Button (PAB) for Outlook versions 1.10.0-1.10.11

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29210,"A local privilege escalation (LPE) vulnerability has been identified in Phish Alert Button for Outlook (PAB), specifically within its configuration management functionalities. This vulnerability allows a regular user to modify the application's configuration file to redirect update checks to an arbitrary server, which can then be exploited in conjunction with CVE-2024-29209 to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

The issue stems from improper permission settings on the application's configuration file, which is stored in a common directory accessible to all users. This file includes critical parameters, such as the update server URL. By default, the application does not enforce adequate access controls on this file, allowing non-privileged users to modify it without administrative consent.

An attacker with regular user access can alter the update server URL specified in the configuration file to point to a malicious server. When the application performs its next update check, it will contact the attacker-controlled server. If the system is also vulnerable to CVE-2024-29209, the attacker can deliver a malicious update package that, when executed, grants them elevated privileges.

Impact:
This vulnerability can lead to a regular user executing code with administrative privileges. This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, installation of additional malware, and a full takeover of the affected system.

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29735,"Improper Preservation of Permissions vulnerability in Apache Airflow.This issue affects Apache Airflow from 2.8.2 through 2.8.3.

Airflow's local file task handler in Airflow incorrectly set permissions for all parent folders of log folder, in default configuration adding write access to Unix group of the folders. In the case Airflow is run with the root user (not recommended) it added group write permission to all folders up to the root of the filesystem.

If your log files are stored in the home directory, these permission changes might impact your ability to run SSH operations after your home directory becomes group-writeable.

This issue does not affect users who use or extend Airflow using Official Airflow Docker reference images ( https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow/ ) - those images require to have group write permission set anyway.

You are affected only if you install Airflow using local installation / virtualenv or other Docker images, but the issue has no impact if docker containers are used as intended, i.e. where Airflow components do not share containers with other applications and users.

Also you should not be affected if your umask is 002 (group write enabled) - this is the default on many linux systems.

Recommendation for users using Airflow outside of the containers:

  *  if you are using root to run Airflow, change your Airflow user to use non-root
  *  upgrade Apache Airflow to 2.8.4 or above
  *  If you prefer not to upgrade, you can change the  https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#file-task-handler-new-folder-permissions  to 0o755 (original value 0o775).
  *  if you already ran Airflow tasks before and your default umask is 022 (group write disabled) you should stop Airflow components, check permissions of AIRFLOW_HOME/logs in all your components and all parent directories of this directory and remove group write access for all the parent directories",CWE-281,"

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29737,"In streampark, the project module integrates Maven's compilation capabilities. The input parameter validation is not strict, allowing attackers to insert commands for remote command execution, The prerequisite for a successful attack is that the user needs to log in to the streampark system and have system-level permissions. Generally, only users of that system have the authorization to log in, and users would not manually input a dangerous operation command. Therefore, the risk level of this vulnerability is very low.

Mitigation:

all users should upgrade to 2.1.4

Background info:

Log in to Streampark using the default username (e.g. test1, test2, test3) and the default password (streampark). Navigate to the Project module, then add a new project. Enter the git repository address of the project and input `touch /tmp/success_2.1.2` as the ""Build Argument"". Note that there is no verification and interception of the special character ""`"". As a result, you will find that this injection command will be successfully executed after executing the build.

In the latest version, the special symbol ` is intercepted.",CWE-77,"
