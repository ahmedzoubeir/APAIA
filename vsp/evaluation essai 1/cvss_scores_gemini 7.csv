        ","## CVSS v3.1 Analysis

Since no CVE description is provided, we cannot determine the specific values for each metric. We need information about the vulnerability to assess its impact and calculate the CVSS score. 

**Here's what we need to know:**

* **What is the vulnerability?** Is it a remote code execution, a denial of service, a privilege escalation, or something else?
* **How is the vulnerability exploited?** Does it require network access, physical access, or local access? 
* **What kind of user interaction is required?** Does the user need to perform an action to trigger the vulnerability?
* **What are the potential consequences?** Can the vulnerability compromise confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data or systems?

**Once we have this information, we can determine the following metrics:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):**  This depends on how the vulnerability is exploited (network, local, physical, etc.).
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** This refers to the difficulty of exploiting the vulnerability. Is it a simple or complex attack?
* **Privileges Required (PR):**  Does the attacker need any specific privileges to exploit the vulnerability?
* **User Interaction (UI):** Is user interaction necessary to trigger the vulnerability?
* **Scope (S):**  Does the vulnerability affect a single user or a wider scope?
* **Confidentiality (C):**  Does the vulnerability compromise confidentiality of data?
* **Integrity (I):**  Does the vulnerability compromise integrity of data?
* **Availability (A):**  Does the vulnerability compromise availability of data or systems?

**Only with the above information can we calculate the final CVSS v3.1 vector string.** 

**Example:**

Let's say the vulnerability is a remote code execution vulnerability that requires no user interaction and can be exploited over the network. 

In this case, we might assign the following values:

* **AV: N (Network)**
* **AC: L (Low)**
* **PR: N (None)**
* **UI: N (None)**
* **S: U (Unchanged)**
* **C: H (High)** - As code execution can lead to data compromise
* **I: H (High)** - As code execution can modify data
* **A: H (High)** - As code execution can cause denial of service

**This would result in the following CVSS v3.1 vector string:**

Since no CVE description is provided, we cannot determine the specific attack vectors, complexities, or impacts. Therefore, we will assume a **worst-case scenario** for each metric to demonstrate the calculation process.

Here's how we would calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score:

**Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N) - This assumes the vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L) - This assumes the exploit is simple to execute.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N) - This assumes the vulnerability can be exploited without any special privileges.
* **User Interaction (UI):** None (N) - This assumes the vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction.
* **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U) - This assumes the vulnerability affects the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system without changing the scope of the attack.
* **Confidentiality (C):** High (H) - This assumes the vulnerability could expose sensitive information.
* **Integrity (I):** High (H) - This assumes the vulnerability could modify data or the system.
* **Availability (A):** High (H) - This assumes the vulnerability could render the system unusable.

**CVSS v3.1 Vector String:**

Since there is no CVE description provided, we cannot accurately determine the values for each CVSS metric. The CVSS Base Score is calculated based on the specific details of the vulnerability. 

**To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score, you need information about the vulnerability, such as:**

* **What is the attack vector?** (e.g., network, local, physical)
* **How complex is the attack?** (e.g., low, high)
* **What privileges are required?** (e.g., none, low, high)
* **Is user interaction required?** (e.g., none, required)
* **Does the vulnerability affect the scope of the attack?** (e.g., unchanged, changed)
* **What impact does the vulnerability have on confidentiality, integrity, and availability?** (e.g., none, low, high)

**Example:**

Let's say the vulnerability is a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability that can be exploited over the network without requiring any user interaction. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain full control over the affected system. In this case, the CVSS metrics might be:

* **AV:** Network (N)
* **AC:** Low (L)
* **PR:** None (N)
* **UI:** None (N)
* **S:** Changed (C) 
* **C:** High (H)
* **I:** High (H)
* **A:** High (H)

        ","## CVSS v3.1 Analysis 

Since no CVE description is provided, we cannot determine the specific vulnerabilities and their associated attack vectors, complexity, privileges required, user interaction, and impact.  

Therefore, we will assume a **hypothetical scenario** to illustrate the CVSS v3.1 calculation process. 

**Let's assume the following hypothetical scenario:**

* **Vulnerability:** A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in a web application. 
* **Exploitation:** An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request to the web application, leading to the execution of arbitrary code on the server.

Based on this scenario, we can assign the following CVSS v3.1 metrics:

* **Attack Vector (AV):** **Network (N)** - The attacker exploits the vulnerability over a network.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** **Low (L)** - The attack requires minimal effort.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** **None (N)** - The attacker doesn't need any specific privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
* **User Interaction (UI):** **None (N)** - The vulnerability can be exploited without user interaction.
* **Scope (S):** **Unchanged (U)** - The exploit affects only the targeted system.
* **Confidentiality (C):** **High (H)** -  The attacker could gain access to sensitive information on the server.
* **Integrity (I):** **High (H)** - The attacker could modify or delete data on the server.
* **Availability (A):** **High (H)** - The attacker could cause the server to become unavailable.

**Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:**

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**

Since there is no CVE description provided, it's impossible to analyze the vulnerability and determine the CVSS v3.1 Base Score.  

To calculate the CVSS score, we need information about the vulnerability, such as:

* **What is affected?** (e.g., software, hardware, protocol)

* **How can the vulnerability be exploited?** (e.g., remote access, local access, physical access)
* **What are the potential impacts?** (e.g., data confidentiality, integrity, availability)

**Without this information, we cannot assign values to the CVSS metrics.**

**Example:**

If the CVE description were to detail a remote code execution vulnerability exploitable through a network connection, then we could assign values like:

* **AV:** Network (N) -  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
* **AC:** Low (L) - The attack complexity is low as it requires minimal effort.
* **PR:** None (N) - No privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
* **UI:** None (N) - No user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
* **S:** Unchanged (U) - The vulnerability affects a single component or service.
* **C:** High (H) - The vulnerability could lead to confidentiality breaches.
* **I:** High (H) - The vulnerability could lead to integrity breaches.
* **A:** High (H) - The vulnerability could lead to availability breaches.

* **The impact of the vulnerability:**  What kind of damage can an attacker cause by exploiting the vulnerability? (e.g., data disclosure, system compromise, denial of service)
* **The attack conditions:** How easy is it for an attacker to exploit the vulnerability? (e.g., requires user interaction, requires specific privileges, requires physical access)

**Once we have this information, we can assign values to the following metrics:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):**  Determines how the attacker interacts with the vulnerable component (e.g., network, physical, local).
* **Attack Complexity (AC):**  Measures the difficulty of exploiting the vulnerability.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** Indicates the privileges an attacker must possess to exploit the vulnerability.
* **User Interaction (UI):** Determines if the vulnerability requires user interaction.
* **Scope (S):** Indicates whether the vulnerability affects a single instance or a larger system.
* **Confidentiality (C):**  Measures the impact of the vulnerability on confidentiality.
* **Integrity (I):** Measures the impact of the vulnerability on integrity.

* **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)**: Assuming the exploitation requires minimal effort or technical knowledge.
* **Privileges Required (PR): None (N)**: Assuming the vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
* **User Interaction (UI): None (N)**: Assuming the vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction.
* **Scope (S): Unchanged (U)**: Assuming the vulnerability impacts only the targeted component.
* **Confidentiality (C): High (H)**: Assuming the vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
* **Integrity (I): High (H)**: Assuming the vulnerability could lead to the modification or deletion of critical data.
* **Availability (A): High (H)**: Assuming the vulnerability could cause a complete denial of service.

Since there is no CVE description provided, it's impossible to analyze the vulnerability and determine the CVSS v3.1 Base Score. The CVSS score relies heavily on the nature of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and the context in which it occurs. 

**To determine the CVSS v3.1 Base Score, we need information about:**

* **The type of vulnerability:** (e.g., buffer overflow, cross-site scripting, remote code execution)
* **The affected software or system:** (e.g., operating system, web application, database)
* **The exploitability of the vulnerability:** (e.g., how easily can it be triggered, what level of access is required)
* **The potential impact of the vulnerability:** (e.g., data disclosure, system compromise, denial of service)

**Without this information, we cannot accurately assess the CVSS metrics.**

mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix stack corruption

When tc filters are first added to a net device, the corresponding local
port gets bound to an ACL group in the device. The group contains a list
of ACLs. In turn, each ACL points to a different TCAM region where the
filters are stored. During forwarding, the ACLs are sequentially
evaluated until a match is found.

One reason to place filters in different regions is when they are added
with decreasing priorities and in an alternating order so that two
consecutive filters can never fit in the same region because of their
key usage.

In Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs the firmware started to report that the
maximum number of ACLs in a group is more than 16, but the layout of the
register that configures ACL groups (PAGT) was not updated to account
for that. It is therefore possible to hit stack corruption [1] in the
rare case where more than 16 ACLs in a group are required.

Fix by limiting the maximum ACL group size to the minimum between what
the firmware reports and the maximum ACLs that fit in the PAGT register.

Add a test case to make sure the machine does not crash when this
condition is hit.

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26589,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Reject variable offset alu on PTR_TO_FLOW_KEYS

For PTR_TO_FLOW_KEYS, check_flow_keys_access() only uses fixed off
for validation. However, variable offset ptr alu is not prohibited
for this ptr kind. So the variable offset is not checked.

The following prog is accepted:

**CVE Description:**  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

`sched/membarrier: reduce the ability to hammer on sys_membarrier`

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

This vulnerability relates to the `sys_membarrier` system call in the Linux kernel. The issue is that the call can be very expensive on some systems, causing performance degradation. To mitigate this, a lock is implemented to serialize accesses and prevent excessive frequency of calls. This suggests a **denial of service** vulnerability. 

**CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):**  **Network (N)** -  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the `sys_membarrier` system call.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** **Low (L)** -  The exploit is relatively simple, requiring only sending malicious requests to the system call.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** **None (N)** -  Exploitation does not require any special privileges.
* **User Interaction (UI):**  **None (N)** -  The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction.
* **Scope (S):** **Unchanged (U)** - The vulnerability impacts the availability of the system, but does not change the scope of the attack.
* **Confidentiality (C):**  **None (N)** - The vulnerability does not directly impact confidentiality.
* **Integrity (I):** **None (N)** - The vulnerability does not directly impact integrity.
* **Availability (A):** **High (H)** -  The vulnerability can cause denial of service by saturating the system with excessive calls to `sys_membarrier`.

The issue here is as follows:

- tidss probes, but is deferred as sii902x is still missing.
- sii902x starts probing and enters sii902x_init().
- sii902x calls drm_bridge_add(). Now the sii902x bridge is ready from
  DRM's perspective.
- sii902x calls sii902x_audio_codec_init() and
  platform_device_register_data()
- The registration of the audio platform device causes probing of the
  deferred devices.
- tidss probes, which eventually causes sii902x_bridge_get_edid() to be
  called.
- sii902x_bridge_get_edid() tries to use the i2c to read the edid.
  However, the sii902x driver has not set up the i2c part yet, leading
  to the crash.

Fix this by moving the drm_bridge_add() to the end of the
sii902x_init(), which is also at the very end of sii902x_probe().

        ","## CVE Analysis and CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation

**CVE Description:** In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

**wifi: iwlwifi: fix a memory corruption**

**Vulnerability Details:** 
The issue stems from a potential memory corruption within the `iwlwifi` driver. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of the `iwl_fw_ini_trigger_tlv::data` pointer. This pointer references a `__le32` data type, indicating a 32-bit integer value. However, if copying data to this pointer using an offset specified in bytes (instead of `__le32` units), the operation could write beyond the allocated buffer, leading to memory corruption.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Metric Analysis:**

* **Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)** - The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network. 
* **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)** - Exploiting the vulnerability doesn't require significant specialized knowledge or complex steps.
* **Privileges Required (PR): None (N)** -  The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker without any privileges.
* **User Interaction (UI): None (N)** - No user interaction is required for an attacker to exploit the vulnerability.
* **Scope (S): Unchanged (U)** - The vulnerability does not require access to additional resources or privileges to exploit it.
* **Confidentiality (C): High (H)** - The vulnerability could allow an attacker to read sensitive information from the affected system.
* **Integrity (I): High (H)** - The vulnerability could allow an attacker to modify data on the affected system.
* **Availability (A): High (H)** - The vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause denial of service (DoS) on the affected system.

This comes from __xdp_return() call with xdp_buff argument passed as
NULL which is supposed to be consumed by xsk_buff_free() call.

To address this properly, in ZC case, a node that represents the frag
being removed has to be pulled out of xskb_list. Introduce
appropriate xsk helpers to do such node operation and use them
accordingly within bpf_xdp_adjust_tail().",No base score found,No vector found,"

- Crash, mostly due to above use-after-free

[CAUSE]
The converted fs has the following data chunk layout:

    item 2 key (FIRST_CHUNK_TREE CHUNK_ITEM 2214658048) itemoff 16025 itemsize 80
        length 86016 owner 2 stripe_len 65536 type DATA|single

For above logical bytenr 2214744064, it's at the chunk end
(2214658048 + 86016 = 2214744064).

This means btrfs_submit_bio() would split the bio, and trigger endio
function for both of the two halves.

However scrub_submit_initial_read() would only expect the endio function
to be called once, not any more.
This means the first endio function would already free the bbio::bio,
leaving the bvec freed, thus the 2nd endio call would lead to
use-after-free.

[FIX]
- Make sure scrub_read_endio() only updates bits in its range
  Since we may read less than 64K at the end of the chunk, we should not
  touch the bits beyond chunk boundary.

- Make sure scrub_submit_initial_read() only to read the chunk range
  This is done by calculating the real number of sectors we need to
  read, and add sector-by-sector to the bio.

Thankfully the scrub read repair path won't need extra fixes:

- scrub_stripe_submit_repair_read()
  With above fixes, we won't update error bit for range beyond chunk,
  thus scrub_stripe_submit_repair_read() should never submit any read
  beyond the chunk.",No base score found,No vector found,"

llc: call sock_orphan() at release time

syzbot reported an interesting trace [1] caused by a stale sk->sk_wq
pointer in a closed llc socket.

In commit ff7b11aa481f (""net: socket: set sock->sk to NULL after
calling proto_ops::release()"") Eric Biggers hinted that some protocols
are missing a sock_orphan(), we need to perform a full audit.

In net-next, I plan to clear sock->sk from sock_orphan() and
amend Eric patch to add a warning.

        ","## CVE Analysis and CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation

**CVE Description:** This vulnerability involves a use-after-free condition in the Linux kernel's LLC (Local Link Control) protocol. The issue occurs when a socket is closed while a stale sk->sk_wq pointer is still in use, leading to a KASAN (Kernel Address Sanitizer) detected memory corruption.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N) - The vulnerability can be exploited over the network.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L) - The exploitation requires minimal effort.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N) - The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.
* **User Interaction (UI):** None (N) - No user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
* **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U) - The vulnerability does not require modifying the system's scope.
* **Confidentiality (C):** High (H) - The attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data due to memory corruption.
* **Integrity (I):** High (H) - The attacker could potentially modify system data due to memory corruption.
* **Availability (A):** High (H) - The attacker could potentially cause system crashes or denial of service due to memory corruption.

**CVSS v3.1 Vector String:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Final CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** 9.8 (Critical)"

scsi: core: Move scsi_host_busy() out of host lock for waking up EH handler

Inside scsi_eh_wakeup(), scsi_host_busy() is called & checked with host
lock every time for deciding if error handler kthread needs to be waken up.

This can be too heavy in case of recovery, such as:

 - N hardware queues

 - queue depth is M for each hardware queue

 - each scsi_host_busy() iterates over (N * M) tag/requests

If recovery is triggered in case that all requests are in-flight, each
scsi_eh_wakeup() is strictly serialized, when scsi_eh_wakeup() is called
for the last in-flight request, scsi_host_busy() has been run for (N * M -
1) times, and request has been iterated for (N*M - 1) * (N * M) times.

If both N and M are big enough, hard lockup can be triggered on acquiring
host lock, and it is observed on mpi3mr(128 hw queues, queue depth 8169).

Fix the issue by calling scsi_host_busy() outside the host lock. We don't

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26629,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: fix RELEASE_LOCKOWNER

The test on so_count in nfsd4_release_lockowner() is nonsense and
harmful.  Revert to using check_for_locks(), changing that to not sleep.

First: harmful.
As is documented in the kdoc comment for nfsd4_release_lockowner(), the
test on so_count can transiently return a false positive resulting in a
return of NFS4ERR_LOCKS_HELD when in fact no locks are held.  This is
clearly a protocol violation and with the Linux NFS client it can cause
incorrect behaviour.

If RELEASE_LOCKOWNER is sent while some other thread is still
processing a LOCK request which failed because, at the time that request
was received, the given owner held a conflicting lock, then the nfsd
thread processing that LOCK request can hold a reference (conflock) to
the lock owner that causes nfsd4_release_lockowner() to return an
incorrect error.

The Linux NFS client ignores that NFS4ERR_LOCKS_HELD error because it
never sends NFS4_RELEASE_LOCKOWNER without first releasing any locks, so
it knows that the error is impossible.  It assumes the lock owner was in
fact released so it feels free to use the same lock owner identifier in
some later locking request.

When it does reuse a lock owner identifier for which a previous RELEASE
failed, it will naturally use a lock_seqid of zero.  However the server,
which didn't release the lock owner, will expect a larger lock_seqid and
so will respond with NFS4ERR_BAD_SEQID.

So clearly it is harmful to allow a false positive, which testing
so_count allows.

The test is nonsense because ... well... it doesn't mean anything.

so_count is the sum of three different counts.
1/ the set of states listed on so_stateids
2/ the set of active vfs locks owned by any of those states
3/ various transient counts such as for conflicting locks.

When it is tested against '2' it is clear that one of these is the
transient reference obtained by find_lockowner_str_locked().  It is not
clear what the other one is expected to be.

In practice, the count is often 2 because there is precisely one state
on so_stateids.  If there were more, this would fail.

In my testing I see two circumstances when RELEASE_LOCKOWNER is called.
In one case, CLOSE is called before RELEASE_LOCKOWNER.  That results in
all the lock states being removed, and so the lockowner being discarded
(it is removed when there are no more references which usually happens
when the lock state is discarded).  When nfsd4_release_lockowner() finds
that the lock owner doesn't exist, it returns success.

The other case shows an so_count of '2' and precisely one state listed
in so_stateid.  It appears that the Linux client uses a separate lock
owner for each file resulting in one lock state per lock owner, so this
test on '2' is safe.  For another client it might not be safe.

So this patch changes check_for_locks() to use the (newish)
find_any_file_locked() so that it doesn't take a reference on the
nfs4_file and so never calls nfsd_file_put(), and so never sleeps.  With
this check is it safe to restore the use of check_for_locks() rather
than testing so_count against the mysterious '2'.",No base score found,No vector found,"

        ","## CVE Analysis and CVSS v3.1 Score Calculation

**CVE Description:** This vulnerability involves an uninitialized variable in the Linux kernel's LLC (Logical Link Control) protocol handling. An attacker could exploit this by sending specially crafted packets with an incorrect protocol type (ETH_P_TR_802_2) which would cause the kernel to access uninitialized memory, potentially leading to a crash or other system instability.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N) - The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through network traffic.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L) - An attacker requires minimal effort to exploit this vulnerability.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N) - The vulnerability can be exploited without any user privileges.
* **User Interaction (UI):** None (N) - The vulnerability does not require user interaction to be exploited.
* **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U) - The exploit does not require changes to the system beyond the initial exploitation.
* **Confidentiality (C):** High (H) - The vulnerability could allow an attacker to access sensitive data stored on the target system.
* **Integrity (I):** High (H) - The vulnerability could allow an attacker to modify data on the target system.
* **Availability (A):** High (H) - The vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause denial of service by crashing the target system.

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26636,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

llc: make llc_ui_sendmsg() more robust against bonding changes

syzbot was able to trick llc_ui_sendmsg(), allocating an skb with no
headroom, but subsequently trying to push 14 bytes of Ethernet header [1]

Like some others, llc_ui_sendmsg() releases the socket lock before
calling sock_alloc_send_skb().
Then it acquires it again, but does not redo all the sanity checks
that were performed.

This fix:

- Uses LL_RESERVED_SPACE() to reserve space.
- Check all conditions again after socket lock is held again.
- Do not account Ethernet header for mtu limitation.

The problem appears to be caused by CPU reordering of writes issued from
__tracing_map_insert().

The check for the presence of an element with a given key in this
function is:

 val = READ_ONCE(entry->val);
 if (val && keys_match(key, val->key, map->key_size)) ...

The write of a new entry is:

 elt = get_free_elt(map);
 memcpy(elt->key, key, map->key_size);
 entry->val = elt;

The ""memcpy(elt->key, key, map->key_size);"" and ""entry->val = elt;""
stores may become visible in the reversed order on another CPU. This
second CPU might then incorrectly determine that a new key doesn't match
an already present val->key and subse

The check for the presence of an element with a given key in this
function is:

 val = READ_ONCE(entry->val);
 if (val && keys_match(key, val->key, map->key_size)) ...

The write of a new entry is:

 elt = get_free_elt(map);
 memcpy(elt->key, key, map->key_size);
 entry->val = elt;

The ""memcpy(elt->key, key, map->key_size);"" and ""entry->val = elt;""

second CPU might then incorrectly determine that a new key doesn't match
an already present val->key and subse

* **Attack Complexity (AC):** **Low (L)** - The vulnerability is straightforward to exploit, requiring only basic knowledge of the tracing map interface and system commands like `stress-ng`.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** **None (N)** -  The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.
* **User Interaction (UI):**  **None (N)** - The vulnerability does not require user interaction.
* **Scope (S):** **Unchanged (U)** -  The vulnerability is limited to the context of the vulnerable component and does not affect other system components.
* **Confidentiality (C):** **None (N)** - The vulnerability does not impact confidentiality.
* **Integrity (I):** **Low (L)** - The vulnerability could potentially lead to unintended behavior or system instability, but it is unlikely to be exploited for data modification.
* **Availability (A):** **Low (L)** - The vulnerability could potentially cause system instability or slowdowns due to the unexpected warning and potential resource exhaustion, but it is unlikely to result in complete system unavailability.

ALSA: sh: aica: reorder cleanup operations to avoid UAF bugs

The dreamcastcard->timer could schedule the spu_dma_work and the
spu_dma_work could also arm the dreamcastcard->timer.

When the snd_pcm_substream is closing, the aica_channel will be
deallocated. But it could still be dereferenced in the worker
thread. The reason is that del_timer() will return directly
regardless of whether the timer handler is running or not and
the worker could be rescheduled in the timer handler. As a result,
the UAF bug will happen. The racy situation is shown below:

        Description:

ALSA: sh: aica: reorder cleanup operations to avoid UAF bugs

The dreamcastcard->timer could schedule the spu_dma_work and the
spu_dma_work could also arm the dreamcastcard->timer.

When the snd_pcm_substream is closing, the aica_channel will be
deallocated. But it could still be dereferenced in the worker
thread. The reason is that del_timer() will return directly
regardless of whether the timer handler is running or not and
the worker could be rescheduled in the timer handler. As a result,
the UAF bug will happen. The racy situation is shown below:

      (Thread 1)                 |      (Thread 2)
snd_aicapcm_pcm_close()          |
 ...                             |  run_spu_dma() //worker
                                 |    mod_timer()
  flush_work()                   |
  del_timer()                    |  aica_period_elapsed() //timer
  kfree(dreamcastcard->channel)  |    schedule_work()
                                 |  run_spu_dma() //worker
  ...                            |    dreamcastcard->channel-> //USE

In order to mitigate this bug and other possible corner cases,
call mod_timer() conditionally in run_spu_dma(), then implement
PCM sync_stop op to cancel both the timer and worker. The sync_stop
op will be called from PCM core appropriately when needed.

drm/amdgpu: fix use-after-free bug

The bug can be triggered by sending a single amdgpu_gem_userptr_ioctl
to the AMDGPU DRM driver on any ASICs with an invalid address and size.
The bug was reported by Joonkyo Jung <joonkyoj@yonsei.ac.kr>.
For example the following code:

static void Syzkaller1(int fd)
{
	struct drm_amdgpu_gem_userptr arg;
	int ret;

	arg.addr = 0xffffffffffff0000;
	arg.size = 0x80000000; /*2 Gb*/
	arg.flags = 0x7;
	ret = drmIoctl(fd, 0xc1186451/*amdgpu_gem_userptr_ioctl*/, &arg);
}

Due to the address and size are not valid there is a failure in
amdgpu_hmm_register->mmu_interval_notifier_insert->__mmu_interval_notifier_insert->
check_shl_overflow, but we even the amdgpu_hmm_register failure we still call
amdgpu_hmm_unregister into  amdgpu_gem_object_free which causes access to a bad address.

        ","## CVE Analysis and CVSS v3.1 Score Calculation:

**CVE Description:** This CVE describes a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's AMDGPU DRM driver. The vulnerability is triggered by sending an invalid address and size in a specific ioctl call (`amdgpu_gem_userptr_ioctl`).  The driver attempts to free an object that has already been freed, leading to potential memory corruption and system instability.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation:**

| Metric | Value | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| **Attack Vector (AV)** | **N** | The vulnerability is exploitable over the network. The exploit can be delivered via a malicious network packet. |
| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | **L** | The vulnerability requires a low level of skill or effort to exploit. The exploit involves sending a crafted ioctl request. |
| **Privileges Required (PR)** | **N** | No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability. Any user on the system can potentially trigger the vulnerability. |
| **User Interaction (UI)** | **N** | User interaction is not required to trigger the vulnerability. The exploit can be executed automatically. |
| **Scope (S)** | **U** | The vulnerability only affects the target system. It does not propagate to other systems. |
| **Confidentiality (C)** | **H** | The vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of confidential information. Memory corruption could expose sensitive data stored in the affected system's memory. |
| **Integrity (I)** | **H** | The vulnerability could lead to modification of data. Memory corruption could allow an attacker to alter system data or execute arbitrary code. |
| **Availability (A)** | **H** | The vulnerability could lead to denial of service. Memory corruption could cause the system to crash or become unresponsive. |

drm/sched: fix null-ptr-deref in init entity

The bug can be triggered by sending an amdgpu_cs_wait_ioctl
to the AMDGPU DRM driver on any ASICs with valid context.
The bug was reported by Joonkyo Jung <joonkyoj@yonsei.ac.kr>.
For example the following code:

    static void Syzkaller2(int fd)
    {
	union drm_amdgpu_ctx arg1;
	union drm_amdgpu_wait_cs arg2;

	arg1.in.op = AMDGPU_CTX_OP_ALLOC_CTX;
	ret = drmIoctl(fd, 0x140106442 /* amdgpu_ctx_ioctl */, &arg1);

	arg2.in.handle = 0x0;
	arg2.in.timeout = 0x2000000000000;
	arg2.in.ip_type = AMD_IP_VPE /* 0x9 */;
	arg2->in.ip_instance = 0x0;
	arg2.in.ring = 0x0;
	arg2.in.ctx_id = arg1.out.alloc.ctx_id;

	drmIoctl(fd, 0xc0206449 /* AMDGPU_WAIT_CS * /, &arg2);
    }

The ioctl AMDGPU_WAIT_CS without previously submitted job could be assumed that
the error should be returned, but the following commit 1decbf6bb0b4dc56c9da6c5e57b994ebfc2be3aa
modified the logic and allowed to have sched_rq equal to NULL.

As a result when there is no job the ioctl AMDGPU_WAIT_CS returns success.
The change fixes null-ptr-deref in init entity and the stack below demonstrates
the error condition:

        Description:
        In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/sched: fix null-ptr-deref in init entity

The bug can be triggered by sending an amdgpu_cs_wait_ioctl
to the AMDGPU DRM driver on any ASICs with valid context.
The bug was reported by Joonkyo Jung <joonkyoj@yonsei.ac.kr>.
For example the following code:

    static void Syzkaller2(int fd)
    {
	union drm_amdgpu_ctx arg1;
	union drm_amdgpu_wait_cs arg2;

	arg1.in.op = AMDGPU_CTX_OP_ALLOC_CTX;
	ret = drmIoctl(fd, 0x140106442 /* amdgpu_ctx_ioctl */, &arg1);

	arg2.in.handle = 0x0;
	arg2.in.timeout = 0x2000000000000;
	arg2.in.ip_type = AMD_IP_VPE /* 0x9 */;
	arg2->in.ip_instance = 0x0;
	arg2.in.ring = 0x0;
	arg2.in.ctx_id = arg1.out.alloc.ctx_id;

	drmIoctl(fd, 0xc0206449 /* AMDGPU_WAIT_CS * /, &arg2);
    }

The ioctl AMDGPU_WAIT_CS without previously submitted job could be assumed that
the error should be returned, but the following commit 1decbf6bb0b4dc56c9da6c5e57b994ebfc2be3aa
modified the logic and allowed to have sched_rq equal to NULL.

As a result when there is no job the ioctl AMDGPU_WAIT_CS returns success.
The change fixes null-ptr-deref in init entity and the stack below demonstrates
the error condition:

net/sched: flower: Fix chain template offload

When a qdisc is deleted from a net device the stack instructs the
underlying driver to remove its flow offload callback from the
associated filter block using the 'FLOW_BLOCK_UNBIND' command. The stack
then continues to replay the removal of the filters in the block for
this driver by iterating over the chains in the block and invoking the
'reoffload' operation of the classifier being used. In turn, the
classifier in its 'reoffload' operation prepares and emits a
'FLOW_CLS_DESTROY' command for each filter.

However, the stack does not do the same for chain templates and the
underlying driver never receives a 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_DESTROY' command when
a qdisc is deleted. This results in a memory leak [1] which can be
reproduced using [2].

Fix by introducing a 'tmplt_reoffload' operation and have the stack
invoke it with the appropriate arguments as part of the replay.
Implement the operation in the sole classifier that supports chain
templates (flower) by emitting the 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_{CREATE,DESTROY}'
command based on whether a flow offload callback is being bound to a
filter block or being unbound from one.

As far as I can tell, the issue happens since cited commit which
reordered tcf_block_offload_unbind() before tcf_block_flush_all_chains()
in __tcf_block_put(). The order cannot be reversed as the filter block
is expected to be freed after flushing all the chains.

        ","## CVE Analysis and CVSS v3.1 Calculation

**CVE Description:** The Linux kernel contains a memory leak vulnerability in the `net/sched` module due to the lack of a `FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_DESTROY` command when a qdisc is deleted. This issue arises from the stack not properly handling chain template destruction, leading to memory leak.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation:**

**1. Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker over the network. This is because the `tc` command, which is used to interact with the `net/sched` module, can be executed remotely.

**2. Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)**

*   An attacker with basic knowledge of the `tc` command can easily exploit this vulnerability.

**3. Privileges Required (PR): None (N)**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any special privileges.

**4. User Interaction (UI): None (N)**

arm64: entry: fix ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD

Currently the ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD workaround isn't
quite right, as it is supposed to be applied after the last explicit
memory access, but is immediately followed by an LDR.

The ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD workaround is used to
handle Cortex-A520 erratum 2966298 and Cortex-A510 erratum 3117295,
which are described in:

* https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN2444153/0600/?lang=en
* https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN1873361/1600/?lang=en

In both cases the workaround is described as:

| If pagetable isolation is disabled, the context switch logic in the
| kernel can be updated to execute the following sequence on affected
| cores before exiting to EL0, and after all explicit memory accesses:
|
| 1. A non-shareable TLBI to any context and/or address, including
|    unused contexts or addresses, such as a `TLBI VALE1 Xzr`.
|
| 2. A DSB NSH to guarantee completion of the TLBI.

The important part being that the TLBI+DSB must be placed ""after all
explicit memory accesses"".

Unfortunately, as-implemented, the TLBI+DSB is immediately followed by
an LDR, as we have:

| alternative_if ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD
| 	tlbi	vale1, xzr
| 	dsb	nsh

| 	add	sp, sp, #PT_REGS_SIZE		// restore sp
| 	eret
| alternative_else_nop_endif
|
| [ ... KPTI exception return path ... ]

This patch fixes this by reworking the logic to place the TLBI+DSB
immediately before the ERET, after all explicit memory accesses.

The ERET is currently in a separate alternative block, and alternatives
cannot be nested. To account for this, the alternative block for
ARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0 is replaced with a single alternative branch
to skip the KPTI logic, with the new shape of the logic being:

| alternative_insn ""b .L_skip_tramp_exit_\@"", nop, ARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0

The new structure means that the workaround is only applied when KPTI is
not in use; this is fine as noted in the documented implications of the

**CVE Description:** This vulnerability in the Linux kernel allows an attacker to potentially cause a denial of service. The vulnerability arises due to a missing sanity check in the ppp_async_ioctl function, which can result in the allocation of excessive memory, leading to a system crash.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Score Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N) - The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the network.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L) -  The vulnerability can be exploited with minimal effort.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N) -  No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
* **User Interaction (UI):** None (N) -  The vulnerability can be exploited without user interaction.
* **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U) - The exploit does not require changing the security context of the system.
* **Confidentiality (C):** None (N) -  The vulnerability does not affect confidentiality.
* **Integrity (I):** None (N) - The vulnerability does not affect integrity.
* **Availability (A):** High (H) - The vulnerability can cause a denial of service by crashing the system.

**CVSS v3.1 Vector String:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26676,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_unix: Call kfree_skb() for dead unix_(sk)->oob_skb in GC.

syzbot reported a warning [0] in __unix_gc() with a repro, which
creates a socketpair and sends one socket's fd to itself using the
peer.

  socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0, [3, 4]) = 0
  sendmsg(4, {msg_name=NULL, msg_namelen=0, msg_iov=[{iov_base=""\360"", iov_len=1}],
          msg_iovlen=1, msg_control=[{cmsg_len=20, cmsg_level=SOL_SOCKET,
                                      cmsg_type=SCM_RIGHTS, cmsg_data=[3]}],
          msg_controllen=24, msg_flags=0}, MSG_OOB|MSG_PROBE|MSG_DONTWAIT|MSG_ZEROCOPY) = 1

This forms a self-cyclic reference that GC should finally untangle
but does not due to lack of MSG_OOB handling, resulting in memory
leak.

Recently, commit 11498715f266 (""af_unix: Remove io_uring code for
GC."") removed io_uring's dead code in GC and revealed the problem.

The code was executed at the final stage of GC and unconditionally
moved all GC candidates from gc_candidates to gc_inflight_list.
That papered over the reported problem by always making the following
WARN_ON_ONCE(!list_empty(&gc_candidates)) false.

The problem has been there since commit 2aab4b969002 (""af_unix: fix
struct pid leaks in OOB support"") added full scm support for MSG_OOB
while fixing another bug.

To fix this problem, we must call kfree_skb() for unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb
if the socket still exists in gc_candidates after purging collected skb.

Then, we need to set NULL to oob_skb before calling kfree_skb() because
it calls last fput() and triggers unix_release_sock(), where we call
duplicate kfree_skb(u->oob_skb) if not NULL.

Note that the leaked socket remained being linked to a global list, so
kmemleak also could not detect it.  We need to check /proc/net/protocol
to notice the unfreed socket.

x86/efistub: Use 1:1 file:memory mapping for PE/COFF .compat section

The .compat section is a dummy PE section that contains the address of
the 32-bit entrypoint of the 64-bit kernel image if it is bootable from
32-bit firmware (i.e., CONFIG_EFI_MIXED=y)

This section is only 8 bytes in size and is only referenced from the
loader, and so it is placed at the end of the memory view of the image,
to avoid the need for padding it to 4k, which is required for sections
appearing in the middle of the image.

Unfortunately, this violates the PE/COFF spec, and even if most EFI
loaders will work correctly (including the Tianocore reference
implementation), PE loaders do exist that reject such images, on the
basis that both the file and memory views of the file contents should be
described by the section headers in a monotonically increasing manner
without leaving any gaps.

**CVE Description:** This vulnerability relates to an incorrect DMA mapping size during memory allocation and deallocation in the Linux kernel's Atlantic network driver. The driver allocates extra memory for the PTP HWTS ring but then frees it with a smaller size, leading to a potential memory corruption.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N) - This vulnerability exploits a flaw in the network driver itself, making it accessible via the network.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L) - The vulnerability can be exploited with minimal effort, as it's a coding error in the driver.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N) -  No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
* **User Interaction (UI):** None (N) - This vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction.
* **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U) -  The vulnerability affects the target system without requiring further actions or interactions.
* **Confidentiality (C):** High (H) - The vulnerability could potentially allow attackers to read sensitive data by exploiting the memory corruption.
* **Integrity (I):** High (H) -  The vulnerability could potentially allow attackers to modify data or execute code by exploiting the memory corruption.
* **Availability (A):** High (H) - The vulnerability could potentially cause a Denial of Service by crashing the system or disrupting its normal operations.

xen/events: close evtchn after mapping cleanup

shutdown_pirq and startup_pirq are not taking the
irq_mapping_update_lock because they can't due to lock inversion. Both
are called with the irq_desc->lock being taking. The lock order,
however, is first irq_mapping_update_lock and then irq_desc->lock.

This opens multiple races:
- shutdown_pirq can be interrupted by a function that allocates an event
  channel:

  CPU0                        CPU1
  shutdown_pirq {
    xen_evtchn_close(e)
                              __startup_pirq {
                                EVTCHNOP_bind_pirq
                                  -> returns just freed evtchn e
                                set_evtchn_to_irq(e, irq)
                              }
    xen_irq_info_cleanup() {
      set_evtchn_to_irq(e, -1)
    }
  }

  Assume here event channel e refers here to the same event channel
  number.
  After this race the evtchn_to_irq mapping for e is invalid (-1).

- __startup_pirq races with __unbind_from_irq in a similar way. Because
  __startup_pirq doesn't take irq_mapping_update_lock it can grab the
  evtchn that __unbind_from_irq is currently freeing and cleaning up. In
  this case even though the event channel is allocated, its mapping can
  be unset in evtchn_to_irq.

The fix is to first cleanup the mappings and then close the event
channel. In this way, when an event channel gets allocated it's
potential previous evtchn_to_irq mappings are guaranteed to be unset already.
This is also the reverse order of the allocation where first the event
channel is allocated and then the mappings are setup.

On a 5.10 kernel prior to commit 3fcdaf3d7634 (""xen/events: modify internal
[un]bind interfaces""), we hit a BUG like the following during probing of NVMe
devices. The issue is that during nvme_setup_io_queues, pci_free_irq
is called for every device which results in a call to shutdown_pirq.
With many nvme devices it's therefore likely to hit this race during
boot because there will be multiple calls to shutdown_pirq and
startup_pirq are running potentially in parallel.

channel. In this way, when an event channel gets allocated it's
potential previous evtchn_to_irq mappings are guaranteed to be unset already.
This is also the reverse order of the allocation where first the event
channel is allocated and then the mappings are setup.

On a 5.10 kernel prior to commit 3fcdaf3d7634 (""xen/events: modify internal
[un]bind interfaces""), we hit a BUG like the following during probing of NVMe
devices. The issue is that during nvme_setup_io_queues, pci_free_irq
is called for every device which results in a call to shutdown_pirq.
With many nvme devices it's therefore likely to hit this race during
boot because there will be multiple calls to shutdown_pirq and
startup_pirq are running potentially in parallel.

fs,hugetlb: fix NULL pointer dereference in hugetlbs_fill_super

When configuring a hugetlb filesystem via the fsconfig() syscall, there is
a possible NULL dereference in hugetlbfs_fill_super() caused by assigning
NULL to ctx->hstate in hugetlbfs_parse_param() when the requested pagesize
is non valid.

E.g: Taking the following steps:

     fd = fsopen(""hugetlbfs"", FSOPEN_CLOEXEC);
     fsconfig(fd, FSCONFIG_SET_STRING, ""pagesize"", ""1024"", 0);
     fsconfig(fd, FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE, NULL, NULL, 0);

Given that the requested ""pagesize"" is invalid, ctxt->hstate will be replaced
with NULL, losing its previous value, and we will print an error:

 ...
 ...
 case Opt_pagesize:
 ps = memparse(param->string, &rest);
 ctx->hstate = h;
 if (!ctx->hstate) {
         pr_err(""Unsupported page size %lu MB\n"", ps / SZ_1M);
         return -EINVAL;
 }
 return 0;
 ...
 ...

This is a problem because later on, we will dereference ctxt->hstate in
hugetlbfs_fill_super()

 ...
 ...
 sb->s_blocksize = huge_page_size(ctx->hstate);
 ...
 ...

Causing below Oops.

Fix this by replacing cxt->hstate value only when then pagesize is known
to be valid.

net: stmmac: protect updates of 64-bit statistics counters

As explained by a comment in <linux/u64_stats_sync.h>, write side of struct
u64_stats_sync must ensure mutual exclusion, or one seqcount update could
be lost on 32-bit platforms, thus blocking readers forever. Such lockups
have been observed in real world after stmmac_xmit() on one CPU raced with
stmmac_napi_poll_tx() on another CPU.

To fix the issue without introducing a new lock, split the statics into
three parts:

1. fields updated only under the tx queue lock,
2. fields updated only during NAPI poll,
3. fields updated only from interrupt context,

Updates to fields in the first two groups are already serialized through

net: stmmac: protect updates of 64-bit statistics counters

As explained by a comment in <linux/u64_stats_sync.h>, write side of struct
u64_stats_sync must ensure mutual exclusion, or one seqcount update could
be lost on 32-bit platforms, thus blocking readers forever. Such lockups
have been observed in real world after stmmac_xmit() on one CPU raced with
stmmac_napi_poll_tx() on another CPU.

To fix the issue without introducing a new lock, split the statics into
three parts:

1. fields updated only under the tx queue lock,
2. fields updated only during NAPI poll,
3. fields updated only from interrupt context,

Updates to fields in the first two groups are already serialized through
other locks. It is sufficient to split the existing struct u64_stats_sync
so that each group has its own.

Note that tx_set_ic_bit is updated from both contexts. Split this counter
so that each context gets its own, and calculate their sum to get the total
value in stmmac_get_ethtool_stats().

For the third group, multiple interrupts may be processed by different CPUs

nilfs2: fix hang in nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers()

Syzbot reported a hang issue in migrate_pages_batch() called by mbind()
and nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() called in the log writer of nilfs2.

While migrate_pages_batch() locks a folio and waits for the writeback to
complete, the log writer thread that should bring the writeback to
completion picks up the folio being written back in
nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() that it calls for subsequent log
creation and was trying to lock the folio.  Thus causing a deadlock.

In the first place, it is unexpected that folios/pages in the middle of
writeback will be updated and become dirty.  Nilfs2 adds a checksum to
verify the validity of the log being written and uses it for recovery at
mount, so data changes during writeback are suppressed.  Since this is
broken, an unclean shutdown could potentially cause recovery to fail.

Investigation revealed that the root cause is that the wait for writeback
completion in nilfs_page_mkwrite() is conditional, and if the backing
device does not require stable writes, data may be modified without
waiting.

In commit ac5047671758 (""hv_netvsc: Disable NAPI before closing the
VMBus channel""), napi_disable was getting called for all channels,
including all subchannels without confirming if they are enabled or not.

This caused hv_netvsc getting hung at napi_disable, when netvsc_probe()
has finished running but nvdev->subchan_work has not started yet.
netvsc_subchan_work() -> rndis_set_subchannel() has not created the
sub-channels and because of that netvsc_sc_open() is not running.
netvsc_remove() calls cancel_work_sync(&nvdev->subchan_work), for which
netvsc_subchan_work did not run.

netif_napi_add() sets the bit NAPI_STATE_SCHED because it ensures NAPI
cannot be scheduled. Then netvsc_sc_open() -> napi_enable will clear the
NAPIF_STATE_SCHED bit, so it can be scheduled. napi_disable() does the
opposite.

Now during netvsc_device_remove(), when napi_disable is called for those
subchannels, napi_disable gets stuck on infinite msleep.

This fix addresses this problem by ensuring that napi_disable() is not
getting called for non-enabled NAPI struct.
But netif_napi_del() is still necessary for these non-enabled NAPI struct
for cleanup purpose.

        ","## CVE Analysis and CVSS v3.1 Calculation

**CVE Description:**  This CVE describes a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) driver for AMD displays. Specifically, the issue lies within the Multiple Stream Transport (MST) functionality for the RV platform, where a null pointer dereference can occur due to a missing check.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):**  **Network (N)** - This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers on the network. The affected code is part of the display driver and is accessible through network protocols like X11 or Wayland. 
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** **Low (L)** -  The exploit is likely to be easy to execute. The null pointer dereference can be triggered by sending specially crafted packets.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** **None (N)** -  No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker can exploit it even without authentication.
* **User Interaction (UI):** **None (N)** - The exploit does not require any user interaction. The vulnerability can be triggered automatically by sending malicious packets.
* **Scope (S):** **Unchanged (U)** - This vulnerability affects the system without altering its security context. The exploitation doesn't grant the attacker elevated privileges.
* **Confidentiality (C):** **High (H)** - The vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information. A successful exploitation could potentially allow attackers to read data from the system's memory, including confidential information.
* **Integrity (I):** **High (H)** - The vulnerability could lead to modification of system data. The null pointer dereference could allow attackers to modify critical system files or data structures, potentially leading to instability or corruption.
* **Availability (A):** **High (H)** - The vulnerability could lead to Denial of Service (DoS). The null pointer dereference could lead to system crashes or other forms of Denial of Service, making the device inaccessible.

        ","## CVE Analysis and CVSS v3.1 Calculation

**CVE Description:** The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel's iio:magnetometer:rm3100 driver, which lacks boundary checks for values read from a hardware register. This can lead to out-of-bounds array access and potential crashes.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):** **Local (L)** - The vulnerability exploits an issue in a local component of the system (the kernel driver).
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** **Low (L)** - The exploitation of this vulnerability requires minimal effort, likely a simple program to trigger the out-of-bounds access.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** **None (N)** - The vulnerability can be exploited by any user with access to the local system.
* **User Interaction (UI):** **None (N)** - No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.
* **Scope (S):** **Unchanged (U)** - The vulnerability only affects the local system, not the broader network.
* **Confidentiality (C):** **None (N)** - The vulnerability does not directly expose confidential information.
* **Integrity (I):** **High (H)** - The vulnerability can lead to a kernel crash, potentially causing data corruption or integrity issues.
* **Availability (A):** **High (H)** - The vulnerability can lead to a kernel crash, which can result in a denial of service.

Currently, the timerlat's hrtimer is initialized at the first read of
timerlat_fd, and destroyed at close(). It works, but it causes an error
if the user program open() and close() the file without reading.

Here's an example:

        You are a cybersecurity expert. Given the following vulnerability description, identify the appropriate CVSS score and vector.
        Return only the base score and vector. If multiple vectors apply, provide the most relevant one.

        Description:
        In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing/timerlat: Move hrtimer_init to timerlat_fd open()

Currently, the timerlat's hrtimer is initialized at the first read of
timerlat_fd, and destroyed at close(). It works, but it causes an error
if the user program open() and close() the file without reading.

Here's an example:

 # echo NO_OSNOISE_WORKLOAD > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/osnoise/options
 # echo timerlat > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer

 # cat <<EOF > ./timerlat_load.py
 # !/usr/bin/env python3

 timerlat_fd = open(""/sys/kernel/tracing/osnoise/per_cpu/cpu0/timerlat_fd"", 'r')
 timerlat_fd.close();
 EOF

 # ./taskset -c 0 ./timerlat_load.py

parisc: Fix random data corruption from exception handler

The current exception handler implementation, which assists when accessing
user space memory, may exhibit random data corruption if the compiler decides
to use a different register than the specified register %r29 (defined in
ASM_EXCEPTIONTABLE_REG) for the error code. If the compiler choose another
register, the fault handler will nevertheless store -EFAULT into %r29 and thus
trash whatever this register is used for.
Looking at the assembly I found that this happens sometimes in emulate_ldd().

To solve the issue, the easiest solution would be if it somehow is
possible to tell the fault handler which register is used to hold the error
code. Using %0 or %1 in the inline assembly is not posssible as it will show
up as e.g. %r29 (with the ""%r"" prefix), which the GNU assembler can not
convert to an integer.

This patch takes another, better and more flexible approach:
We extend the __ex_table (which is out of the execution path) by one 32-word.
In this word we tell the compiler to insert the assembler instruction
""or %r0,%r0,%reg"", where %reg references the register which the compiler
choosed for the error return code.
In case of an access failure, the fault handler finds the __ex_table entry and
can examine the opcode. The used register is encoded in the lowest 5 bits, and
the fault handler can then store -EFAULT into this register.

The above added iommu_device structure to pci_controller. During
system boot, PCI devices are discovered and this newly added iommu_device
structure is initialized by a call to iommu_device_register().

During DLPAR add of a PCI device, a new pci_controller structure is
allocated but there are no calls made to iommu_device_register()
interface.

Fix is to register the iommu device during DLPAR add as well.

Commit a940904443e4 (""powerpc/iommu: Add iommu_ops to report capabilities
and allow blocking domains"") broke DLPAR add of PCI devices.

The above added iommu_device structure to pci_controller. During
system boot, PCI devices are discovered and this newly added iommu_device
structure is initialized by a call to iommu_device_register().

During DLPAR add of a PCI device, a new pci_controller structure is
allocated but there are no calls made to iommu_device_register()
interface.

Fix is to register the iommu device during DLPAR add as well.

the structure that contains the tasklet or if it calls some code that may

it is not a sufficient fix and the data corruption can still happen [1].
There is no fix for dm-verity and dm-verity will write into free memory

drm/i915/dsc: Fix the macro that calculates DSCC_/DSCA_ PPS reg address

Commit bd077259d0a9 (""drm/i915/vdsc: Add function to read any PPS
register"") defines a new macro to calculate the DSC PPS register
addresses with PPS number as an input. This macro correctly calculates
the addresses till PPS 11 since the addresses increment by 4. So in that
case the following macro works correctly to give correct register
address:

_MMIO(_DSCA_PPS_0 + (pps) * 4)

However after PPS 11, the register address for PPS 12 increments by 12
because of RC Buffer memory allocation in between. Because of this
discontinuity in the address space, the macro calculates wrong addresses
for PPS 12 - 16 resulting into incorrect DSC PPS parameter value
read/writes causing DSC corruption.

This fixes it by correcting this macro to add the offset of 12 for PPS
>=12.

The issue as follows: __netlink_dump_start() calls control->start(cb)

Then nlk->cb_mutex is released and taken again in netlink_dump(), while
dpll_lock still being held. That leads to ABBA deadlock when another
CPU races with the same operation.

Fix this by moving dpll_lock taking into dumpit() callback which ensures

This happens because we fail to write out the free space cache in one
instance, come back around and attempt to write it again.  However on
the second pass through we go to call btrfs_get_extent() on the inode to
get the extent mapping.  Because this is a new block group, and with the
free space inode we always search the commit root to avoid deadlocking
with the tree, we find nothing and return a EXTENT_MAP_HOLE for the
requested range.

This happens because the first time we try to write the space cache out
we hit an error, and on an error we drop the extent mapping.  This is
normal for normal files, but the free space cache inode is special.  We
always expect the extent map to be correct.  Thus the second time
through we end up with a bogus extent map.

Since we're deprecating this feature, the most straightforward way to
fix this is to simply skip dropping the extent map range for this failed

[CAUSE]
During create_subvol(), after inserting root item for the newly created
subvolume, we would trigger btrfs_get_new_fs_root() to get the
btrfs_root of that subvolume.

The idea here is, we have preallocated an anonymous device number for
the subvolume, thus we can assign it to the new subvolume.

But there is really nothing preventing things like backref walk to read
the new subvolume.
If that happens before we call btrfs_get_new_fs_root(), the subvolume
would be read out, with a new anonymous device number assigned already.

In that case, we would trigger ASSERT(), as we really expect no one to
read out that subvolume (which is not yet accessible from the fs).
But things like backref walk is still possible to trigger the read on
the subvolume.

Thus our assumption on the ASSERT() is not correct in the first place.

[FIX]
Fix it by removing the ASSERT(), and just free the @anon_dev, reset it
to 0, and continue.

If the subvolume tree is read out by something else, it should have
already get a new anon_dev assigned thus we only need to free the
preallocated one.",No base score found,No vector found,"

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26729,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix potential null pointer dereference in dc_dmub_srv

Fixes potential null pointer dereference warnings in the
dc_dmub_srv_cmd_list_queue_execute() and dc_dmub_srv_is_hw_pwr_up()
functions.

In both functions, the 'dc_dmub_srv' variable was being dereferenced
before it was checked for null. This could lead to a null pointer
dereference if 'dc_dmub_srv' is null. The fix is to check if
'dc_dmub_srv' is null before dereferencing it.

drm/amd/display: Fix potential null pointer dereference in dc_dmub_srv

Fixes potential null pointer dereference warnings in the
dc_dmub_srv_cmd_list_queue_execute() and dc_dmub_srv_is_hw_pwr_up()
functions.

In both functions, the 'dc_dmub_srv' variable was being dereferenced
before it was checked for null. This could lead to a null pointer
dereference if 'dc_dmub_srv' is null. The fix is to check if
'dc_dmub_srv' is null before dereferencing it.

Thus moving the null checks for 'dc_dmub_srv' to the beginning of the
functions to ensure that 'dc_dmub_srv' is not null when it is
dereferenced.

        ","## CVE Analysis and CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation

**CVE Description:** The vulnerability is a lockdep violation in the Linux kernel's af_unix support of SO_PEEK_OFF. The issue arises from the inherent thread-unsafety of SO_PEEK_OFF, leading to potential deadlocks when multiple threads access the same socket.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)**  - The vulnerability can be exploited over the network. The attacker doesn't need physical access to the target system.
* **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)** - The exploit requires minimal effort and technical skill.
* **Privileges Required (PR): None (N)** - No privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
* **User Interaction (UI): None (N)** - No user interaction is required for exploitation.
* **Scope (S): Unchanged (U)** - The vulnerability affects only the targeted component.
* **Confidentiality (C): Low (L)** - The vulnerability could potentially lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
* **Integrity (I): High (H)** -  The vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to modify the target system's state.
* **Availability (A): High (H)** - The vulnerability could lead to denial-of-service conditions, causing the target system to become unavailable.

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26733,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arp: Prevent overflow in arp_req_get().

syzkaller reported an overflown write in arp_req_get(). [0]

When ioctl(SIOCGARP) is issued, arp_req_get() looks up an neighbour
entry and copies neigh->ha to struct arpreq.arp_ha.sa_data.

The arp_ha here is struct sockaddr, not struct sockaddr_storage, so
the sa_data buffer is just 14 bytes.

In the splat below, 2 bytes are overflown to the next int field,
arp_flags.  We initialise the field just after the memcpy(), so it's
not a problem.

However, when dev->addr_len is greater than 22 (e.g. MAX_ADDR_LEN),
arp_netmask is overwritten, which could be set as htonl(0xFFFFFFFFUL)
in arp_ioctl() before calling arp_req_get().

To avoid the overflow, let's limit the max length of memcpy().

Note that commit b5f0de6df6dc (""net: dev: Convert sa_data to flexible
array in struct sockaddr"") just silenced syzkaller.

        Description:
        In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arp: Prevent overflow in arp_req_get().

syzkaller reported an overflown write in arp_req_get(). [0]

When ioctl(SIOCGARP) is issued, arp_req_get() looks up an neighbour
entry and copies neigh->ha to struct arpreq.arp_ha.sa_data.

The arp_ha here is struct sockaddr, not struct sockaddr_storage, so
the sa_data buffer is just 14 bytes.

In the splat below, 2 bytes are overflown to the next int field,
arp_flags.  We initialise the field just after the memcpy(), so it's
not a problem.

However, when dev->addr_len is greater than 22 (e.g. MAX_ADDR_LEN),
arp_netmask is overwritten, which could be set as htonl(0xFFFFFFFFUL)
in arp_ioctl() before calling arp_req_get().

To avoid the overflow, let's limit the max length of memcpy().

Note that commit b5f0de6df6dc (""net: dev: Convert sa_data to flexible
array in struct sockaddr"") just silenced syzkaller.

memcpy: detected field-spanning write (size 16) of single field ""r->arp_ha.sa_data"" at net/ipv4/arp.c:1128 (size 14)

**CVE Description:** In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: act_mirred: don't override retval if we already lost the skb

This vulnerability involves a use-after-free (UaF) condition in the Linux kernel's network scheduler (net/sched) module. The vulnerability occurs when a specific code path mishandles the return value (retval) of the tcf_mirred_forward() function, potentially leading to memory corruption and system instability.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N) - The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a network connection.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L) - The vulnerability is relatively easy to exploit. 
* **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N) - An attacker does not need special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
* **User Interaction (UI):** None (N) - No user interaction is required for exploitation.
* **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U) - The vulnerability does not impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data outside the affected component.
* **Confidentiality (C):** High (H) - The vulnerability can lead to disclosure of sensitive information, as an attacker could potentially gain access to the memory contents of the affected system. 
* **Integrity (I):** High (H) - The vulnerability can lead to modification of data, as an attacker could potentially corrupt the system's memory and alter its behavior.
* **Availability (A):** High (H) - The vulnerability can cause denial of service, as an attacker could potentially crash the system or render it unresponsive.

dccp/tcp: Unhash sk from ehash for tb2 alloc failure after check_estalblished().

syzkaller reported a warning [0] in inet_csk_destroy_sock() with no
repro.

  WARN_ON(inet_sk(sk)->inet_num && !inet_csk(sk)->icsk_bind_hash);

However, the syzkaller's log hinted that connect() failed just before
the warning due to FAULT_INJECTION.  [1]

When connect() is called for an unbound socket, we search for an
available ephemeral port.  If a bhash bucket exists for the port, we
call __inet_check_established() or __inet6_check_established() to check
if the bucket is reusable.

If reusable, we add the socket into ehash and set inet_sk(sk)->inet_num.

Later, we look up the corresponding bhash2 bucket and try to allocate
it if it does not exist.

Although it rarely occurs in real use, if the allocation fails, we must
revert the changes by check_established().  Otherwise, an unconnected
socket could illegally occupy an ehash entry.

Note that we do not put tw back into ehash because sk might have
already responded to a packet for tw and it would be better to free
tw earlier under such memory presure.

At the time of LPAR dump, before kexec hands over control to kdump
kernel, DDWs (Dynamic DMA Windows) are scanned and added to the FDT.
For the SR-IOV case, default DMA window ""ibm,dma-window"" is removed from
the FDT and DDW added, for the device.

Now, kexec hands over control to the kdump kernel.

When the kdump kernel initializes, PCI busses are scanned and IOMMU
group/tables created, in pci_dma_bus_setup_pSeriesLP(). For the SR-IOV
case, there is no ""ibm,dma-window"". The original commit: b1fc44eaa9ba,
fixes the path where memory is pre-mapped (direct mapped) to the DDW.

tables.

iommu_table_setparms_lpar() only considers ""ibm,dma-window"" property

SR-IOV device, NULL pointer execption is thrown from iommu_area_alloc().

The fix is to initialize the IOMMU table with DDW property stored in the

	1. For the dedicated adapter, kdump kernel would encounter both
	   default and DDW in FDT. In this case, DDW property is used to

	2. A DDW could be direct or dynamic mapped. kdump kernel would
	   initialize IOMMU table and mark the existing DDW as
	   ""dynamic"". This works fine since, at the time of table

        ","## CVSS v3.1 Base Score Analysis

**CVE Description:** The Linux kernel contains a use-after-free vulnerability in the cdns3 gadget driver. The vulnerability occurs due to freeing a memory region (`priv_req`) before it is completely removed from a linked list (`priv_req->list`).

**CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):** **N (Network)** - The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through network connections.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** **L (Low)** - The vulnerability is relatively easy to exploit.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** **N (None)** - No specific privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
* **User Interaction (UI):** **N (None)** - No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
* **Scope (S):** **U (Unchanged)** - The vulnerability does not affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data outside the vulnerable component.
* **Confidentiality (C):** **H (High)** - The vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
* **Integrity (I):** **H (High)** - The vulnerability could allow an attacker to modify data or system state.
* **Availability (A):** **H (High)** - The vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation:**

The base score is calculated using the following formula:

```
Base Score = (Impact Subscore + Exploitability Subscore) * Base Score Modifier
```

**Impact Subscore = (C x 1.0 + I x 1.0 + A x 1.0) * Impact Modifier**

- Impact Modifier = 1.0 (since Scope is Unchanged)
- Impact Subscore = (H x 1.0 + H x 1.0 + H x 1.0) * 1.0 = 3.0

**Exploitability Subscore = (AV x 0.85 + AC x 0.62 + PR x 0.51 + UI x 0.68) * Exploitability Modifier**

- Exploitability Modifier = 1.0 (since Scope is Unchanged)
- Exploitability Subscore = (N x 0.85 + L x 0.62 + N x 0.51 + N x 0.68) * 1.0 = 2.06

**Base Score = (3.0 + 2.06) * 1.0 = 5.06**

**Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:**

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**"

However, I missed a case that oob_skb has self-referencing fd and
another fd and the latter sk is placed before the former in the

__unix_gc() has the same loop just before purging the collected skb,

mm/swap: fix race when skipping swapcache

When skipping swapcache for SWP_SYNCHRONOUS_IO, if two or more threads
swapin the same entry at the same time, they get different pages (A, B). 
Before one thread (T0) finishes the swapin and installs page (A) to the
PTE, another thread (T1) could finish swapin of page (B), swap_free the
entry, then swap out the possibly modified page reusing the same entry. 
It breaks the pte_same check in (T0) because PTE value is unchanged,
causing ABA problem.  Thread (T0) will install a stalled page (A) into the
PTE and cause data corruption.

One possible callstack is like this:

CPU0                                 CPU1
----                                 ----

<direct swapin path>                 <direct swapin path>
<alloc page A>                       <alloc page B>
swap_read_folio() <- read to page A  swap_read_folio() <- read to page B
<slow on later locks or interrupt>   <finished swapin first>
...                                  set_pte_at()
                                     swap_free() <- entry is free
                                     <write to page B, now page A stalled>
                                     <swap out page B to same swap entry>
pte_same() <- Check pass, PTE seems
              unchanged, but page A
              is stalled!
swap_free() <- page B content lost!
set_pte_at() <- staled page A installed!

And besides, for ZRAM, swap_free() allows the swap device to discard the
entry content, so even if page (B) is not modified, if swap_read_folio()
on CPU0 happens later than swap_free() on CPU1, it may also cause data
loss.

To fix this, reuse swapcache_prepare which will pin the swap entry using
the cache flag, and allow only one thread to swap it in, also prevent any
parallel code from putting the entry in the cache.  Release the pin after
PT unlocked.

Racers just loop and wait since it's a rare and very short event.  A
schedule_timeout_uninterruptible(1) call is added to avoid repeated page
faults wasting too much CPU, causing livelock or adding too much noise to
perf statistics.  A similar livelock issue was described in commit
029c4628b2eb (""mm: swap: get rid of livelock in swapin readahead"")

Reproducer:

This race issue can be triggered easily using a well constructed
reproducer and patched brd (with a delay in read path) [1]:

With latest 6.8 mainline, race caused data loss can be observed easily:
$ gcc -g -lpthread test-thread-swap-race.c && ./a.out
  Polulating 32MB of memory region...
  Keep swapping out...
  Starting round 0...
  Spawning 65536 workers...
  32746 workers spawned, wait for done...
  Round 0: Error on 0x5aa00, expected 32746, got 32743, 3 data loss!
  Round 0: Error on 0x395200, expected 32746, got 32743, 3 data loss!
  Round 0: Error on 0x3fd000, expected 32746, got 32737, 9 data loss!
  Round 0 Failed, 15 data loss!

This reproducer spawns multiple threads sharing the same memory region
using a small swap device.  Every two threads updates mapped pages one by
one in opposite direction trying to create a race, with one dedicated
thread keep swapping out the data out using madvise.

The reproducer created a reproduce rate of about once every 5 minutes, so
the race should be totally possible in production.

After this patch, I ran the reproducer for over a few hundred rounds and
no data loss observed.

If an SDMA send consists of exactly 6 descriptors and requires dword
padding (in the 7th descriptor), the sdma_txreq descriptor array is not
properly expanded and the packet will overflow into the container
structure. This results in a panic when the send completion runs. The
exact panic varies depending on what elements of the container structure
get corrupted. The fix is to use the correct expression in
_pad_sdma_tx_descs() to test the need to expand the descriptor array.

If an SDMA send consists of exactly 6 descriptors and requires dword
padding (in the 7th descriptor), the sdma_txreq descriptor array is not
properly expanded and the packet will overflow into the container
structure. This results in a panic when the send completion runs. The
exact panic varies depending on what elements of the container structure
get corrupted. The fix is to use the correct expression in
_pad_sdma_tx_descs() to test the need to expand the descriptor array.

With this patch the crashes are no longer reproducible and the machine is
stable.

LoongArch: Change acpi_core_pic[NR_CPUS] to acpi_core_pic[MAX_CORE_PIC]

With default config, the value of NR_CPUS is 64. When HW platform has
more then 64 cpus, system will crash on these platforms. MAX_CORE_PIC
is the maximum cpu number in MADT table (max physical number) which can
exceed the supported maximum cpu number (NR_CPUS, max logical number),
but kernel should not crash. Kernel should boot cpus with NR_CPUS, let
the remainder cpus stay in BIOS.

The potential crash reason is that the array acpi_core_pic[NR_CPUS] can
be overflowed when parsing MADT table, and it is obvious that CORE_PIC
should be corresponding to physical core rather than logical core, so it
is better to define the array as acpi_core_pic[MAX_CORE_PIC].

With the patch, system can boot up 64 vcpus with qemu parameter -smp 128,
otherwise system will crash with the following message.

wifi: mac80211: fix race condition on enabling fast-xmit

fast-xmit must only be enabled after the sta has been uploaded to the driver,
otherwise it could end up passing the not-yet-uploaded sta via drv_tx calls
to the driver, leading to potential crashes because of uninitialized drv_priv
data.

        ","## CVE Analysis and CVSS v3.1 Calculation

**CVE Description:**  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

**wifi: mac80211: fix race condition on enabling fast-xmit**

**Vulnerability Description:** A race condition exists in the Linux kernel's wifi mac80211 driver when enabling fast-xmit. If fast-xmit is enabled before the station (sta) is uploaded to the driver, it can lead to passing the uninitialized sta to the driver via drv_tx calls, resulting in potential crashes due to uninitialized drv_priv data.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation:**

**1. Attack Vector (AV):**  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending malicious network traffic to the vulnerable device. 
**AV: Network (N)**

**2. Attack Complexity (AC):**  The attacker needs to send crafted network traffic to exploit the vulnerability. This requires a moderate level of effort.
**AC: Low (L)**

**3. Privileges Required (PR):**  An attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
**PR: None (N)**

**4. User Interaction (UI):**  The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction.
**UI: None (N)**

**5. Scope (S):**  The vulnerability affects the entire system. 
**S: Unchanged (U)**

**6. Confidentiality (C):** The vulnerability can potentially lead to a crash, which could disclose sensitive information.
**C: High (H)**

**7. Integrity (I):**  The vulnerability can potentially lead to a crash, which could lead to data corruption or integrity issues.
**I: High (H)**

**8. Availability (A):**  The vulnerability can potentially lead to a crash, resulting in denial of service.
**A: High (H)**

**Final CVSS v3.1 Base Score:**  Using the CVSS v3.1 calculator with the above metrics, the base score is **9.8**.

**CVSS v3.1 Vector String:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26780,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_unix: Fix task hung while purging oob_skb in GC.

syzbot reported a task hung; at the same time, GC was looping infinitely
in list_for_each_entry_safe() for OOB skb.  [0]

syzbot demonstrated that the list_for_each_entry_safe() was not actually
safe in this case.

A single skb could have references for multiple sockets.  If we free such
a skb in the list_for_each_entry_safe(), the current and next sockets could
be unlinked in a single iteration.

unix_notinflight() uses list_del_init() to unlink the socket, so the
prefetched next socket forms a loop itself and list_for_each_entry_safe()
never stops.

Here, we must use while() and make sure we always fetch the first socket.

**Base Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N) - The vulnerability can be exploited over the network.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L) - The attack requires minimal effort to exploit the vulnerability.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N) - No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
* **User Interaction (UI):** None (N) - No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.
* **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U) - The vulnerability does not require a change in the scope of the attack.
* **Confidentiality (C):** None (N) - The vulnerability does not directly impact confidentiality.
* **Integrity (I):** Low (L) - The vulnerability could potentially lead to data corruption.
* **Availability (A):** High (H) - The vulnerability can cause a system crash or denial of service.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation:**

* Base Score = (0.85 * Impact) * (0.65 * Exploitability)
* Impact = (10.5 * (0.0 * C + 0.3 * I + 0.7 * A)) / 21
* Exploitability = (8.5 * (0.85 * AV + 0.22 * AC + 0.56 * PR + 0.35 * UI)) / 20

**Calculation:**

* Exploitability = (8.5 * (0.85 * 0.85 + 0.22 * 0.75 + 0.56 * 0 + 0.35 * 0)) / 20 = 0.47
* Impact = (10.5 * (0.0 * 0 + 0.3 * 0.35 + 0.7 * 0.75)) / 21 = 0.28
* Base Score = (0.85 * 0.28) * (0.65 * 0.47) = **0.07**

**CVE Description:** This vulnerability involves a potential deadlock in the Linux kernel's mptcp subflow diagnostic functionality. The issue arises from a circular dependency in lock acquisition, leading to potential system instability.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N) -  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L) - The exploit is relatively straightforward to execute.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N) - No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
* **User Interaction (UI):** None (N) - The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction.
* **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U) - The vulnerability affects the system as a whole, not just a single component.
* **Confidentiality (C):** High (H) -  An attacker could potentially access sensitive information on the target system.
* **Integrity (I):** High (H) - An attacker could potentially modify data or system state on the target system.
* **Availability (A):** High (H) - An attacker could potentially cause the system to become unavailable.

mm/vmscan: fix a bug calling wakeup_kswapd() with a wrong zone index

With numa balancing on, when a numa system is running where a numa node
doesn't have its local memory so it has no managed zones, the following

wrong zone index, -1.  Fixed it by checking the index before calling
wakeup_kswapd().

mm/vmscan: fix a bug calling wakeup_kswapd() with a wrong zone index

With numa balancing on, when a numa system is running where a numa node
doesn't have its local memory so it has no managed zones, the following
oops has been observed.  It's because wakeup_kswapd() is called with a
wrong zone index, -1.  Fixed it by checking the index before calling
wakeup_kswapd().

        ","## CVE Description Analysis and CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation:

The provided CVE description details a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's memory management (mm/vmscan) where `wakeup_kswapd()` is called with an incorrect zone index (-1) when a NUMA node lacks local memory. This leads to a system crash due to a page fault.

**Here's the breakdown of the CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):** **Local (L)**. The vulnerability can only be exploited by an attacker with local access to the affected system. 
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** **Low (L)**. The exploit requires minimal effort and technical expertise to trigger.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** **High (H)**. An attacker must have root privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
* **User Interaction (UI):** **None (N)**. No user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
* **Scope (S):** **Unchanged (U)**. The vulnerability affects the single system where it is present.
* **Confidentiality (C):** **High (H)**. The vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information stored on the affected system.
* **Integrity (I):** **High (H)**. The vulnerability could lead to unauthorized modification of data stored on the affected system.
* **Availability (A):** **High (H)**. The vulnerability could lead to denial of service on the affected system due to the crash.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation:**

The CVSS v3.1 Base Score is calculated using the formula: 

`Impact Subscore + Exploitability Subscore`

* **Impact Subscore:** (10.5 + 6.4 + 6.4) - (0.85 x 10.5 x 6.4 x 6.4) = 21.15
* **Exploitability Subscore:** (0.85 x 8.8 x 5.9 x 1) = 4.67

**Final CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** 21.15 + 4.67 = **25.82**

**CVSS v3.1 Vector String:**

DMA API debug brings to light leaking dma-mappings as dma_map_sg and
dma_unmap_sg are not correctly balanced.

If an error occurs in mmci_cmd_irq function, only mmci_dma_error
function is called and as this API is not managed on stm32 variant,
dma_unmap_sg is never called in this error path.
        ","## CVE Description Analysis and CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation

**CVE Description:** This vulnerability in the Linux kernel arises due to an error in DMA mapping handling in the ""mmc: mmci: stm32"" driver.  When an error occurs during an MMC command, the `dma_unmap_sg` function is not called, leading to a memory leak and potential resource exhaustion.

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26794,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix race between ordered extent completion and fiemap

For fiemap we recently stopped locking the target extent range for the
whole duration of the fiemap call, in order to avoid a deadlock in a
scenario where the fiemap buffer happens to be a memory mapped range of
the same file. This use case is very unlikely to be useful in practice but
it may be triggered by fuzz testing (syzbot, etc).

However by not locking the target extent range for the whole duration of
the fiemap call we can race with an ordered extent. This happens like
this:

1) The fiemap task finishes processing a file extent item that covers
   the file range [512K, 1M[, and that file extent item is the last item
   in the leaf currently being processed;

2) And ordered extent for the file range [768K, 2M[, in COW mode,
   completes (btrfs_finish_one_ordered()) and the file extent item
   covering the range [512K, 1M[ is trimmed to cover the range
   [512K, 768K[ and then a new file extent item for the range [768K, 2M[
   is inserted in the inode's subvolume tree;

3) The fiemap task calls fiemap_next_leaf_item(), which then calls
   btrfs_next_leaf() to find the next leaf / item. This finds that the
   the next key following the one we previously processed (its type is
   BTRFS_EXTENT_DATA_KEY and its offset is 512K), is the key corresponding
   to the new file extent item inserted by the ordered extent, which has
   a type of BTRFS_EXTENT_DATA_KEY and an offset of 768K;

4) Later the fiemap code ends up at emit_fiemap_extent() and triggers
   the warning:

      if (cache->offset + cache->len > offset) {
               WARN_ON(1);
               return -EINVAL;
      }

   Since we get 1M > 768K, because the previously emitted entry for the
   old extent covering the file range [512K, 1M[ ends at an offset that
   is greater than the new extent's start offset (768K). This makes fiemap
   fail with -EINVAL besides triggering the warning that produces a stack
   trace like the following:

        Description:
        In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix race between ordered extent completion and fiemap

For fiemap we recently stopped locking the target extent range for the
whole duration of the fiemap call, in order to avoid a deadlock in a
scenario where the fiemap buffer happens to be a memory mapped range of
the same file. This use case is very unlikely to be useful in practice but
it may be triggered by fuzz testing (syzbot, etc).

However by not locking the target extent range for the whole duration of
the fiemap call we can race with an ordered extent. This happens like
this:

1) The fiemap task finishes processing a file extent item that covers
   the file range [512K, 1M[, and that file extent item is the last item
   in the leaf currently being processed;

2) And ordered extent for the file range [768K, 2M[, in COW mode,
   completes (btrfs_finish_one_ordered()) and the file extent item
   covering the range [512K, 1M[ is trimmed to cover the range
   [512K, 768K[ and then a new file extent item for the range [768K, 2M[
   is inserted in the inode's subvolume tree;

3) The fiemap task calls fiemap_next_leaf_item(), which then calls
   btrfs_next_leaf() to find the next leaf / item. This finds that the
   the next key following the one we previously processed (its type is
   BTRFS_EXTENT_DATA_KEY and its offset is 512K), is the key corresponding
   to the new file extent item inserted by the ordered extent, which has
   a type of BTRFS_EXTENT_DATA_KEY and an offset of 768K;

4) Later the fiemap code ends up at emit_fiemap_extent() and triggers
   the warning:

      if (cache->offset + cache->len > offset) {
               WARN_ON(1);
               return -EINVAL;
      }

   Since we get 1M > 768K, because the previously emitted entry for the
   old extent covering the file range [512K, 1M[ ends at an offset that
   is greater than the new extent's start offset (768K). This makes fiemap
   fail with -EINVAL besides triggering the warning that produces a stack
   trace like the following:

**CVE Description:**  The vulnerability resides in the Linux kernel's drm/amd/display component and specifically in the `map_hw_resources` function. This function accesses arrays using an index that could exceed the array's boundaries, leading to a buffer overflow. 

**CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):**  **Local (L)** - The vulnerability requires the attacker to have local access to the system. The description mentions a buffer overflow in a specific function within the Linux kernel, which implies local exploitation.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** **Low (L)** - The vulnerability can be exploited with minimal effort. The description mentions that the index used to access the arrays is out of bounds, suggesting a straightforward exploitation path.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** **High (H)** - The vulnerability requires the attacker to have high privileges (e.g., root) to modify the kernel.
* **User Interaction (UI):** **None (N)** - The vulnerability doesn't require any user interaction to exploit. The buffer overflow occurs due to an error in the `map_hw_resources` function, which is executed automatically.
* **Scope (S):** **Unchanged (U)** - The vulnerability affects only the vulnerable component (the kernel) and doesn't have a wider impact. 
* **Confidentiality (C):** **High (H)** - The buffer overflow could potentially lead to disclosure of sensitive information stored in the kernel memory.
* **Integrity (I):** **High (H)** - The buffer overflow could potentially lead to modification of the kernel's memory, allowing attackers to change the system's behavior.
* **Availability (A):** **High (H)** - The buffer overflow could potentially crash the system or prevent it from functioning correctly, impacting its availability.

stmmac: Clear variable when destroying workqueue

Currently when suspending driver and stopping workqueue it is checked whether
workqueue is not NULL and if so, it is destroyed.
Function destroy_workqueue() does drain queue and does clear variable, but
it does not set workqueue variable to NULL. This can cause kernel/module
panic if code attempts to clear workqueue that was not initialized.

This scenario is possible when resuming suspended driver in stmmac_resume(),
because there is no handling for failed stmmac_hw_setup(),
which can fail and return if DMA engine has failed to initialize,
and workqueue is initialized after DMA engine.
Should DMA engine fail to initialize, resume will proceed normally,
but interface won't work and TX queue will eventually timeout,
causing 'Reset adapter' error.
This then does destroy workqueue during reset process.
And since workqueue is initialized after DMA engine and can be skipped,
it will cause kernel/module panic.

To secure against this possible crash, set workqueue variable to NULL when
destroying workqueue.

Function destroy_workqueue() does drain queue and does clear variable, but
it does not set workqueue variable to NULL. This can cause kernel/module
panic if code attempts to clear workqueue that was not initialized.

This scenario is possible when resuming suspended driver in stmmac_resume(),
because there is no handling for failed stmmac_hw_setup(),
which can fail and return if DMA engine has failed to initialize,
and workqueue is initialized after DMA engine.
Should DMA engine fail to initialize, resume will proceed normally,
but interface won't work and TX queue will eventually timeout,
causing 'Reset adapter' error.
This then does destroy workqueue during reset process.
And since workqueue is initialized after DMA engine and can be skipped,
it will cause kernel/module panic.

To secure against this possible crash, set workqueue variable to NULL when
destroying workqueue.

Log/backtrace from crash goes as follows:

        ","## CVE Analysis and CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation

**CVE Description:** This vulnerability in the Linux kernel arises from a failure to properly clear a variable when destroying a workqueue. When a driver is suspended and the workqueue is destroyed, the `destroy_workqueue()` function drains the queue and clears the variable. However, it does not set the workqueue variable to NULL, which can lead to a kernel panic if code tries to access the uninitialized workqueue.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Metric Values:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):** **Local (L)** - The vulnerability requires local access to the affected system to exploit it.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** **Low (L)** - The exploit requires minimal effort to execute successfully.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** **None (N)** - No specific privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
* **User Interaction (UI):** **None (N)** - No user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
* **Scope (S):** **Unchanged (U)** - The exploit does not affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of other systems or applications.
* **Confidentiality (C):** **None (N)** - The vulnerability does not impact confidentiality.
* **Integrity (I):** **High (H)** - The vulnerability could cause a system crash, leading to data loss or corruption, impacting integrity.
* **Availability (A):** **High (H)** - A kernel panic would render the affected system unavailable, impacting availability.

The splat occurs because skb->data points past skb->head allocated area.
This is because neigh layer does:
  __skb_pull(skb, skb_network_offset(skb));

... but skb_network_offset() returns a negative offset and __skb_pull()
arg is unsigned.  IOW, we skb->data gets ""adjusted"" by a huge value.

The negative value is returned because skb->head and skb->data distance is
more than 64k and skb->network_header (u16) has wrapped around.

The bug is in the ip_tunnel infrastructure, which can cause
dev->needed_headroom to increment ad infinitum.

The syzkaller reproducer consists of packets getting routed via a gre
tunnel, and route of gre encapsulated packets pointing at another (ipip)
tunnel.  The ipip encapsulation finds gre0 as next output device.

This results in the following pattern:

1). First packet is to be sent out via gre0.
Route lookup found an output device, ipip0.

2).
ip_tunnel_xmit for gre0 bumps gre0->needed_headroom based on the future
output device, rt.dev->needed_headroom (ipip0).

3).
ip output / start_xmit moves skb on to ipip0. which runs the same
code path again (xmit recursion).

4).
Routing step for the post-gre0-encap packet finds gre0 as output device
to use for ipip0 encapsulated packet.

tunl0->needed_headroom is then incremented based on the (already bumped)
gre0 device headroom.

This repeats for every future packet:

gre0->needed_headroom gets inflated because previous packets' ipip0 step
incremented rt->dev (gre0) headroom, and ipip0 incremented because gre0
needed_headroom was increased.

For each subsequent packet, gre/ipip0->needed_headroom grows until
post-expand-head reallocations result in a skb->head/data distance of
more than 64k.

Once that happens, skb->network_header (u16) wraps around when
pskb_expand_head tries to make sure that skb_network_offset() is unchanged
after the headroom expansion/reallocation.

After this skb_network_offset(skb) returns a different (and negative)
result post headroom expansion.

The next trip to neigh layer (or anything else that would __skb_pull the
network header) makes skb->data point to a memory location outside
skb->head area.

netlink: Fix kernel-infoleak-after-free in __skb_datagram_iter

syzbot reported the following uninit-value access issue [1]:

netlink_to_full_skb() creates a new `skb` and puts the `skb->data`
passed as a 1st arg of netlink_to_full_skb() onto new `skb`. The data
size is specified as `len` and passed to skb_put_data(). This `len`
is based on `skb->end` that is not data offset but buffer offset. The
`skb->end` contains data and tailroom. Since the tailroom is not
initialized when the new `skb` created, KMSAN detects uninitialized
memory area when copying the data.

This patch resolved this issue by correct the len from `skb->end` to
`skb->len`, which is the actual data offset.

netlink: Fix kernel-infoleak-after-free in __skb_datagram_iter

syzbot reported the following uninit-value access issue [1]:

netlink_to_full_skb() creates a new `skb` and puts the `skb->data`
passed as a 1st arg of netlink_to_full_skb() onto new `skb`. The data
size is specified as `len` and passed to skb_put_data(). This `len`
is based on `skb->end` that is not data offset but buffer offset. The
`skb->end` contains data and tailroom. Since the tailroom is not
initialized when the new `skb` created, KMSAN detects uninitialized
memory area when copying the data.

This patch resolved this issue by correct the len from `skb->end` to
`skb->len`, which is the actual data offset.

spi: cadence-qspi: remove system-wide suspend helper calls from runtime PM hooks

The ->runtime_suspend() and ->runtime_resume() callbacks are not

This obviously cannot be correct, unless ""struct cqspi_st"" is the
first member of "" struct spi_controller"", or the other way around, but
it is not the case. ""struct spi_controller"" is allocated by
devm_spi_alloc_host(), which allocates an extra amount of memory for

The ->probe() function of the cadence-quadspi driver then sets the
device drvdata to store the address of the ""struct cqspi_st""

is correct, but:

	struct spi_controller *host = dev_get_drvdata(dev);

is not, as it makes ""host"" point not to a ""struct spi_controller"" but
to the same ""struct cqspi_st"" structure as above.

This obviously leads to bad things (memory corruption, kernel crashes)
directly during ->probe(), as ->probe() enables the device using PM
runtime, leading the ->runtime_resume() hook being called, which in
turns calls spi_controller_resume() with the wrong pointer.

        Description:
        In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vfio/pci: Create persistent INTx handler

A vulnerability exists where the eventfd for INTx signaling can be
deconfigured, which unregisters the IRQ handler but still allows
eventfds to be signaled with a NULL context through the SET_IRQS ioctl
or through unmask irqfd if the device interrupt is pending.

Ideally this could be solved with some additional locking; the igate
mutex serializes the ioctl and config space accesses, and the interrupt
handler is unregistered relative to the trigger, but the irqfd path
runs asynchronous to those.  The igate mutex cannot be acquired from the
atomic context of the eventfd wake function.  Disabling the irqfd
relative to the eventfd registration is potentially incompatible with
existing userspace.

As a result, the solution implemented here moves configuration of the
INTx interrupt handler to track the lifetime of the INTx context object
and irq_type configuration, rather than registration of a particular
trigger eventfd.  Synchronization is added between the ioctl path and
eventfd_signal() wrapper such that the eventfd trigger can be
dynamically updated relative to in-flight interrupts or irqfd callbacks.

vfio/platform: Create persistent IRQ handlers

The vfio-platform SET_IRQS ioctl currently allows loopback triggering of
an interrupt before a signaling eventfd has been configured by the user,
which thereby allows a NULL pointer dereference.

Rather than register the IRQ relative to a valid trigger, register all
IRQs in a disabled state in the device open path.  This allows mask
operations on the IRQ to nest within the overall enable state governed
by a valid eventfd signal.  This decouples @masked, protected by the
@locked spinlock from @trigger, protected via the @igate mutex.

In doing so, it's guaranteed that changes to @trigger cannot race the
IRQ handlers because the IRQ handler is synchronously disabled before
modifying the trigger, and loopback triggering of the IRQ via ioctl is
safe due to serialization with trigger changes via igate.

For compatibility, request_irq() failures are maintained to be local to
the SET_IRQS ioctl rather than a fatal error in the open device path.

**CVE Description:** In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

`cifs: fix underflow in parse_server_interfaces()`

**Analysis:**

The vulnerability lies in the `parse_server_interfaces()` function within the CIFS (Common Internet File System) implementation of the Linux kernel. This function parses server interface information, and due to a type mismatch between `ssize_t` and `size_t`, an underflow condition can occur. When `bytes_left` is negative, the loop continues instead of ending, potentially leading to out-of-bounds access and potential memory corruption.

i40e: Do not allow untrusted VF to remove administratively set MAC

Currently when PF administratively sets VF's MAC address and the VF
is put down (VF tries to delete all MACs) then the MAC is removed
from MAC filters and primary VF MAC is zeroed.

Do not allow untrusted VF to remove primary MAC when it was set
administratively by PF.

Reproducer:
1) Create VF
2) Set VF interface up
3) Administratively set the VF's MAC
4) Put VF interface down

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26837,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: bridge: switchdev: Skip MDB replays of deferred events on offload

Before this change, generation of the list of MDB events to replay
would race against the creation of new group memberships, either from
the IGMP/MLD snooping logic or from user configuration.

While new memberships are immediately visible to walkers of
br->mdb_list, the notification of their existence to switchdev event
subscribers is deferred until a later point in time. So if a replay
list was generated during a time that overlapped with such a window,
it would also contain a replay of the not-yet-delivered event.

The driver would thus receive two copies of what the bridge internally
considered to be one single event. On destruction of the bridge, only
a single membership deletion event was therefore sent. As a
consequence of this, drivers which reference count memberships (at
least DSA), would be left with orphan groups in their hardware
database when the bridge was destroyed.

This is only an issue when replaying additions. While deletion events
may still be pending on the deferred queue, they will already have
been removed from br->mdb_list, so no duplicates can be generated in
that scenario.

To a user this meant that old group memberships, from a bridge in
which a port was previously attached, could be reanimated (in
hardware) when the port joined a new bridge, without the new bridge's
knowledge.

For example, on an mv88e6xxx system, create a snooping bridge and
immediately add a port to it:

    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ ip link add dev br0 up type bridge mcast_snooping 1 && \
    > ip link set dev x3 up master br0

And then destroy the bridge:

    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ ip link del dev br0
    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ mvls atu
    ADDRESS             FID  STATE      Q  F  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a
    DEV:0 Marvell 88E6393X

    33:33:ff:87:e4:3f     1  static     -  -  0  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
    ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff     1  static     -  -  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a
    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$

The two IPv6 groups remain in the hardware database because the
port (x3) is notified of the host's membership twice: once via the
original event and once via a replay. Since only a single delete
notification is sent, the count remains at 1 when the bridge is
destroyed.

Then add the same port (or another port belonging to the same hardware
domain) to a new bridge, this time with snooping disabled:

    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ ip link add dev br1 up type bridge mcast_snooping 0 && \
    > ip link set dev x3 up master br1

All multicast, including the two IPv6 groups from br0, should now be
flooded, according to the policy of br1. But instead the old
memberships are still active in the hardware database, causing the
switch to only forward traffic to those groups towards the CPU (port
0).

Eliminate the race in two steps:

1. Grab the write-side lock of the MDB while generating the replay
   list.

This prevents new memberships from showing up while we are generating
the replay list. But it leaves the scenario in which a deferred event
was already generated, but not delivered, before we grabbed the
lock. Therefore:

2. Make sure that no deferred version of a replay event is already
   enqueued to the switchdev deferred queue, before adding it to the
   replay list, when replaying additions.",No base score found,No vector found,"
        You are a cybersecurity expert. Given the following vulnerability description, identify the appropriate CVSS score and vector.
        Return only the base score and vector. If multiple vectors apply, provide the most relevant one.

        ","## CVE Description Analysis and CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation

**CVE Description:** The Linux kernel contains a use-after-free vulnerability in the `ip6_route_mpath_notify()` function. This vulnerability arises from a race condition where the `fib6_info_release()` function is called too early, potentially freeing memory that is still in use.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)** - The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through network communication.
* **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)** - The exploit requires minimal effort and technical skill.
* **Privileges Required (PR): None (N)** -  An attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
* **User Interaction (UI): None (N)** - The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction.
* **Scope (S): Unchanged (U)** - The exploit does not change the security context of the target system.
* **Confidentiality (C): High (H)** - A successful exploit could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from the target system.
* **Integrity (I): High (H)** - A successful exploit could allow an attacker to modify data on the target system.
* **Availability (A): High (H)** - A successful exploit could lead to denial of service (DoS) conditions, rendering the target system unavailable.

**CVSS v3.1 Vector String:** 
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26853,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

igc: avoid returning frame twice in XDP_REDIRECT

When a frame can not be transmitted in XDP_REDIRECT
(e.g. due to a full queue), it is necessary to free
it by calling xdp_return_frame_rx_napi.

However, this is the responsibility of the caller of
the ndo_xdp_xmit (see for example bq_xmit_all in
kernel/bpf/devmap.c) and thus calling it inside
igc_xdp_xmit (which is the ndo_xdp_xmit of the igc
driver) as well will lead to memory corruption.

In fact, bq_xmit_all expects that it can return all
frames after the last successfully transmitted one.
Therefore, break for the first not transmitted frame,
but do not call xdp_return_frame_rx_napi in igc_xdp_xmit.
This is equally implemented in other Intel drivers
such as the igb.

There are two alternatives to this that were rejected:
1. Return num_frames as all the frames would have been
   transmitted and release them inside igc_xdp_xmit.
   While it might work technically, it is not what
   the return value is meant to represent (i.e. the
   number of SUCCESSFULLY transmitted packets).
2. Rework kernel/bpf/devmap.c and all drivers to
   support non-consecutively dropped packets.
   Besides being complex, it likely has a negative
   performance impact without a significant gain
   since it is anyway unlikely that the next frame
   can be transmitted if the previous one was dropped.

The memory corruption can be reproduced with
the following script which leads to a kernel panic
after a few seconds.  It basically generates more
traffic than a i225 NIC can transmit and pushes it
via XDP_REDIRECT from a virtual interface to the
physical interface where frames get dropped.

**Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):** **Network (N)**  - The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, requiring network access.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** **Low (L)** - The vulnerability requires minimal effort to exploit.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** **None (N)** - No user interaction or privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
* **User Interaction (UI):** **None (N)** - No user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
* **Scope (S):** **Unchanged (U)** - The vulnerability affects the target system directly.
* **Confidentiality (C):** **High (H)** - An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information by exploiting the vulnerability. 
* **Integrity (I):** **High (H)** - An attacker could potentially modify or corrupt system data or processes by exploiting the vulnerability.

        In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Use a memory barrier to enforce PTP WQ xmit submission tracking occurs after populating the metadata_map

Just simply reordering the functions mlx5e_ptp_metadata_map_put and
mlx5e_ptpsq_track_metadata in the mlx5e_txwqe_complete context is not good
enough since both the compiler and CPU are free to reorder these two
functions. If reordering does occur, the issue that was supposedly fixed by
7e3f3ba97e6c (""net/mlx5e: Track xmit submission to PTP WQ after populating
metadata map"") will be seen. This will lead to NULL pointer dereferences in
mlx5e_ptpsq_mark_ts_cqes_undelivered in the NAPI polling context due to the
tracking list being populated before the metadata map.
        ","## CVE Analysis and CVSS v3.1 Calculation

        ","## CVE Analysis and CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation:

**CVE Description:** This CVE describes a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's handling of HSR (High-speed Ring) protocol packets. The issue arises when a packet with an ETH_P_PRP or ETH_P_HSR type ID is received but lacks the required HSR tag. This leads to an uninitialized value access, potentially allowing an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition or exploit other vulnerabilities.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation:**

**Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N) - The vulnerability is exploitable through network communication. 
**Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L) -  Exploitation requires minimal effort. 
**Privileges Required (PR):** None (N) -  Exploitation does not require any special privileges. 
**User Interaction (UI):** None (N) -  Exploitation does not require user interaction. 
**Scope (S):** Unchanged (U) -  The vulnerability does not affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of other resources beyond the targeted system.
**Confidentiality (C):** None (N) -  The vulnerability does not affect confidentiality.
**Integrity (I):** Low (L) - The vulnerability could potentially lead to data corruption or modification.
**Availability (A):** High (H) -  The vulnerability could potentially cause denial-of-service conditions.

**Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H

**Summary of Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector:** Network
* **Attack Complexity:** Low
* **Privileges Required:** None
* **User Interaction:** None
* **Scope:** Unchanged
* **Confidentiality:** None
* **Integrity:** Low
* **Availability:** High

**CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.5 (High)**"

tcp: Fix refcnt handling in __inet_hash_connect().

syzbot reported a warning in sk_nulls_del_node_init_rcu().

The commit 66b60b0c8c4a (""dccp/tcp: Unhash sk from ehash for tb2 alloc
failure after check_estalblished()."") tried to fix an issue that an
unconnected socket occupies an ehash entry when bhash2 allocation fails.

In such a case, we need to revert changes done by check_established(),
which does not hold refcnt when inserting socket into ehash.

So, to revert the change, we need to __sk_nulls_add_node_rcu() instead
of sk_nulls_add_node_rcu().

Otherwise, sock_put() will cause refcnt underflow and leak the socket.

        ","## CVE Description Analysis and CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation:

This CVE describes a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's TCP implementation related to refcnt handling during socket connection. The issue arises from incorrect refcnt management when an unconnected socket fails to allocate bhash2 memory. This can lead to refcnt underflow and socket leaks.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N) - The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L) - The exploitation does not require sophisticated techniques.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N) - No specific privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
* **User Interaction (UI):** None (N) - No user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
* **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U) - The vulnerability affects the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the target system in isolation.
* **Confidentiality (C):** High (H) - The vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. 
* **Integrity (I):** High (H) - The vulnerability could allow attackers to modify system data or configuration.
* **Availability (A):** High (H) - The vulnerability could cause the system to become unavailable or unresponsive.

rds: tcp: Fix use-after-free of net in reqsk_timer_handler().

syzkaller reported a warning of netns tracker [0] followed by KASAN
splat [1] and another ref tracker warning [1].

syzkaller could not find a repro, but in the log, the only suspicious
sequence was as follows:

  18:26:22 executing program 1:
  r0 = socket$inet6_mptcp(0xa, 0x1, 0x106)
  ...
  connect$inet6(r0, &(0x7f0000000080)={0xa, 0x4001, 0x0, @loopback}, 0x1c) (async)

The notable thing here is 0x4001 in connect(), which is RDS_TCP_PORT.

So, the scenario would be:

  1. unshare(CLONE_NEWNET) creates a per netns tcp listener in
      rds_tcp_listen_init().
  2. syz-executor connect()s to it and creates a reqsk.
  3. syz-executor exit()s immediately.
  4. netns is dismantled.  [0]
  5. reqsk timer is fired, and UAF happens while freeing reqsk.  [1]
  6. listener is freed after RCU grace period.  [2]

Basically, reqsk assumes that the listener guarantees netns safety
until all reqsk timers are expired by holding the listener's refcount.
However, this was not the case for kernel sockets.

Commit 740ea3c4a0b2 (""tcp: Clean up kernel listener's reqsk in
inet_twsk_purge()"") fixed this issue only for per-netns ehash.

Let's apply the same fix for the global ehash.

        ","## CVE Description Analysis:

The CVE description details a use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability in the Linux kernel's RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets) TCP implementation. This occurs because a timer function (`reqsk_timer_handler()`) accesses a `reqsk` structure after it has been freed.

**Base Metric Values:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):**  **Network (N)** - The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a network connection.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** **Low (L)** - The exploit requires minimal effort.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** **None (N)** - The vulnerability does not require any specific privileges.
* **User Interaction (UI):** **None (N)** - The vulnerability does not require user interaction.
* **Scope (S):** **Unchanged (U)** - The exploit does not change the scope of the attack.
* **Confidentiality (C):** **High (H)** - The vulnerability could allow an attacker to access confidential data.
* **Integrity (I):** **High (H)** - The vulnerability could allow an attacker to modify system data.
* **Availability (A):** **High (H)** - The vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause denial-of-service.

        ","## CVSS v3.1 Base Score Analysis

**CVE Description:**  The vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel's SPI driver, specifically within the `fsl_lpspi_probe()` function. The function handles memory allocation and disposal manually, but the `devm` management system used to register the SPI controller doesn't properly handle memory freeing in the event of an error. This leads to a potential use-after-free condition when the memory is accessed after being freed.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Metric Analysis:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):** **Local (L)** - The vulnerability is exploitable by an attacker with local access to the target system, as the code execution occurs during the device driver initialization.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** **Low (L)** - The vulnerability doesn't require any specific actions or complex techniques from the attacker. The vulnerability triggers during the driver initialization process.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** **None (N)** - The vulnerability requires no specific user privileges to exploit.
* **User Interaction (UI):** **None (N)** - The vulnerability does not require any user interaction. It triggers during the driver initialization process.
* **Scope (S):** **Unchanged (U)** - The vulnerability impacts only the local system, without affecting other systems.
* **Confidentiality (C):** **High (H)** - A successful exploit could potentially allow an attacker to read sensitive information from the system's memory.
* **Integrity (I):** **High (H)** - A successful exploit could potentially allow an attacker to modify sensitive information in the system's memory.
* **Availability (A):** **High (H)** - A successful exploit could potentially crash the system or cause a denial of service.

comedi: comedi_8255: Correct error in subdevice initialization

The refactoring done in commit 5c57b1ccecc7 (""comedi: comedi_8255: Rework
subdevice initialization functions"") to the initialization of the io
field of struct subdev_8255_private broke all cards using the
drivers/comedi/drivers/comedi_8255.c module.

Prior to 5c57b1ccecc7, __subdev_8255_init() initialized the io field
in the newly allocated struct subdev_8255_private to the non-NULL
callback given to the function, otherwise it used a flag parameter to
select between subdev_8255_mmio and subdev_8255_io. The refactoring
removed that logic and the flag, as subdev_8255_mm_init() and
subdev_8255_io_init() now explicitly pass subdev_8255_mmio and
subdev_8255_io respectively to __subdev_8255_init(), only
__subdev_8255_init() never sets spriv->io to the supplied
callback. That spriv->io is NULL leads to a later BUG:

comedi: comedi_8255: Correct error in subdevice initialization

The refactoring done in commit 5c57b1ccecc7 (""comedi: comedi_8255: Rework
subdevice initialization functions"") to the initialization of the io
field of struct subdev_8255_private broke all cards using the
drivers/comedi/drivers/comedi_8255.c module.

Prior to 5c57b1ccecc7, __subdev_8255_init() initialized the io field
in the newly allocated struct subdev_8255_private to the non-NULL
callback given to the function, otherwise it used a flag parameter to
select between subdev_8255_mmio and subdev_8255_io. The refactoring
removed that logic and the flag, as subdev_8255_mm_init() and
subdev_8255_io_init() now explicitly pass subdev_8255_mmio and
subdev_8255_io respectively to __subdev_8255_init(), only
__subdev_8255_init() never sets spriv->io to the supplied
callback. That spriv->io is NULL leads to a later BUG:

NFSv4.2: fix nfs4_listxattr kernel BUG at mm/usercopy.c:102

A call to listxattr() with a buffer size = 0 returns the actual
size of the buffer needed for a subsequent call. When size > 0,
nfs4_listxattr() does not return an error because either
generic_listxattr() or nfs4_listxattr_nfs4_label() consumes
exactly all the bytes then size is 0 when calling
nfs4_listxattr_nfs4_user() which then triggers the following
kernel BUG:

semaphore and send the ABORT_DEV command to the device. However, the
internal abort timed out due to the 2 bit ECC error and triggers automatic

This is because when the device goes offline, we obtain the hisi_hba
semaphore and send the ABORT_DEV command to the device. However, the
internal abort timed out due to the 2 bit ECC error and triggers automatic
dump. In addition, since the hisi_hba semaphore has been obtained, the dump
cannot be executed and the controller cannot be reset.

Therefore, the deadlocks occur on the following circular dependencies

        ","## CVE Analysis and CVSS v3.1 Calculation

**CVE Description:** The vulnerability described is a use-after-free (UAF) in the `pvr2_context_set_notify` function within the Linux kernel's `pvrusb2` driver. The issue arises due to improper synchronization, where a task releases a memory pointer (`mp`) before another task has finished using it. This leads to the second task attempting to access freed memory, causing a crash.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):** **Network (N)** - The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network as the `pvrusb2` driver interacts with USB devices.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** **Low (L)** - The exploit requires minimal technical skill and knowledge.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** **None (N)** - No specific privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
* **User Interaction (UI):** **None (N)** - The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction.
* **Scope (S):** **Unchanged (U)** - The vulnerability does not affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of other systems.
* **Confidentiality (C):** **High (H)** - An attacker can potentially access sensitive information stored in the memory being accessed after it has been freed.
* **Integrity (I):** **High (H)** - An attacker can potentially modify data stored in the memory being accessed after it has been freed.
* **Availability (A):** **High (H)** - An attacker can potentially cause a system crash or denial of service by exploiting this vulnerability.

* **Attack Complexity (AC):** **Low (L)** - The exploit does not require complex actions or technical expertise. The vulnerability triggers due to a race condition, making exploitation relatively straightforward.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** **High (H)** - Exploiting this vulnerability requires elevated privileges, as the kernel driver operates at a privileged level.
* **User Interaction (UI):** **None (N)** - The exploit doesn't require any user interaction, it's purely triggered by the race condition in the kernel code.
* **Scope (S):** **Unchanged (U)** -  The impact of this vulnerability is confined to the affected system, no further systems are compromised.
* **Confidentiality (C):** **None (N)** - The vulnerability does not directly disclose any confidential information.
* **Integrity (I):** **High (H)** - The crash caused by the vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS) and potentially cause data corruption or integrity issues.
* **Availability (A):** **High (H)** -  The crash results in a system outage, making it unavailable.

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26880,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm: call the resume method on internal suspend

There is this reported crash when experimenting with the lvm2 testsuite.
The list corruption is caused by the fact that the postsuspend and resume
methods were not paired correctly; there were two consecutive calls to the
origin_postsuspend function. The second call attempts to remove the
""hash_list"" entry from a list, while it was already removed by the first
call.

Fix __dm_internal_resume so that it calls the preresume and resume
methods of the table's targets.

If a preresume method of some target fails, we are in a tricky situation.
We can't return an error because dm_internal_resume isn't supposed to
return errors. We can't return success, because then the ""resume"" and
""postsuspend"" methods would not be paired correctly. So, we set the
DMF_SUSPENDED flag and we fake normal suspend - it may confuse userspace
tools, but it won't cause a kernel crash.

        You are a cybersecurity expert. Given the following vulnerability description, identify the appropriate CVSS score and vector.
        Return only the base score and vector. If multiple vectors apply, provide the most relevant one.

        Description:
        In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm: call the resume method on internal suspend

There is this reported crash when experimenting with the lvm2 testsuite.
The list corruption is caused by the fact that the postsuspend and resume
methods were not paired correctly; there were two consecutive calls to the
origin_postsuspend function. The second call attempts to remove the
""hash_list"" entry from a list, while it was already removed by the first
call.

Fix __dm_internal_resume so that it calls the preresume and resume
methods of the table's targets.

If a preresume method of some target fails, we are in a tricky situation.
We can't return an error because dm_internal_resume isn't supposed to
return errors. We can't return success, because then the ""resume"" and
""postsuspend"" methods would not be paired correctly. So, we set the
DMF_SUSPENDED flag and we fake normal suspend - it may confuse userspace
tools, but it won't cause a kernel crash.

1ca1ba465e55 (""geneve: make sure to pull inner header in geneve_rx()"")

We have to save skb->network_header in a temporary variable
in order to be able to recompute the network_header pointer
after a pskb_inet_may_pull() call.

pskb_inet_may_pull() makes sure the needed headers are in skb->head.

        ","## CVE Description Analysis and CVSS v3.1 Calculation

**CVE Description:** This vulnerability occurs in the Linux kernel within the `ip_tunnel_rcv()` function, where the inner header is not properly handled leading to an uninitialized value. This issue arises due to the `pskb_inet_may_pull()` function, which is responsible for ensuring necessary headers are present within the `skb->head` pointer, but does not update the `skb->network_header` pointer accordingly. This discrepancy can result in the `network_header` pointer pointing to an uninitialized memory location, potentially leading to a system crash or other unforeseen consequences.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)** - The vulnerability is exploitable through a network connection.
* **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)** - An attacker with basic network access can exploit this vulnerability.

        ","## CVSS v3.1 Base Score Analysis

**CVE Description:** In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

*bpf: Fix hashtab overflow check on 32-bit arches*

**Analysis:**

The vulnerability arises from a potential overflow during the calculation of hash buckets in the Linux kernel's hashtab code on 32-bit architectures. This overflow could be triggered by user input that leads to the creation of a large number of hash buckets, exceeding the capacity of the 32-bit data type.

**Base Metric Values:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):** **Network (N)** - The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, as the hashtab code is accessible over the network.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** **Low (L)** -  The vulnerability can be exploited with minimal effort and technical skills.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** **None (N)** - The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
* **User Interaction (UI):** **None (N)** - The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction.
* **Scope (S):** **Unchanged (U)** - The vulnerability does not require any changes in the security context of the attacker.
* **Confidentiality (C):** **High (H)** -  The vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of confidential information by allowing an attacker to access the kernel's memory.
* **Integrity (I):** **High (H)** - The vulnerability could allow an attacker to modify kernel data or even execute arbitrary code.
* **Availability (A):** **High (H)** -  The vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service by crashing the kernel or causing it to become unresponsive.

        ","## CVE Analysis and CVSS v3.1 Calculation

**CVE Description:** In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_core: Fix possible buffer overflow

**Vulnerability Summary:** 
This vulnerability stems from a potential buffer overflow in the `hci_core` module of the Linux kernel's Bluetooth stack. The `struct hci_dev_info` structure has a fixed-size `name[8]` field, which could be overrun if the actual device name is longer than 8 characters. This is because the code uses `strcpy` to copy the device name, which doesn't perform bounds checking.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)** - The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via Bluetooth connections.
* **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)** - The exploit is straightforward and doesn't require significant complexity.
* **Privileges Required (PR): None (N)** - The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any specific user privileges.
* **User Interaction (UI): None (N)** - The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction.
* **Scope (S): Unchanged (U)** - The vulnerability affects the target system without impacting other systems.
* **Confidentiality (C): High (H)** - An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data stored on the device.
* **Integrity (I): High (H)** - An attacker could potentially modify data on the device.
* **Availability (A): High (H)** - An attacker could potentially cause denial of service by crashing the Bluetooth stack.

**Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:**

**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**"

Bluetooth: btrtl: fix out of bounds memory access

The problem is detected by KASAN.
btrtl driver uses private hci data to store 'struct btrealtek_data'.
If btrtl driver is used with btusb, then memory for private hci data
is allocated in btusb. But no private data is allocated after hci_dev,
when btrtl is used with hci_h5.

This commit adds memory allocation for hci_h5 case.

        ","## CVSS v3.1 Base Score Analysis

**CVE Description:** This vulnerability concerns the Linux kernel's handling of IOMMU device-TLB invalidation requests when a hotplug capable device is disconnected. The kernel incorrectly issues an invalidation request for a non-existent device, leading to a deadly loop, continuous hard lockup warnings, and system hang.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):** **Network (N)** - The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker over the network.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** **Low (L)** - An attacker with network access can easily exploit the vulnerability.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** **None (N)** - No user interaction or special privileges are required for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability.
* **User Interaction (UI):** **None (N)** - The vulnerability does not require user interaction to be exploited.
* **Scope (S):** **Unchanged (U)** - The vulnerability only affects the target system, not other systems within the network.
* **Confidentiality (C):** **High (H)** - The vulnerability can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information stored on the affected system.
* **Integrity (I):** **High (H)** - The vulnerability can allow an attacker to modify data on the affected system.
* **Availability (A):** **High (H)** - The vulnerability can cause the affected system to become unavailable.

David Mosberger-Tan initial investigation [1] showed that this
use-after-free is due to netdevice unregistration during vif list
traversal. When unregistering a net device, since the needs_free_netdev has
been set to true during registration, the netdevice object is also freed,
and as a consequence, the corresponding vif object too, since it is
attached to it as private netdevice data. The next occurrence of the loop
then tries to access freed vif pointer to the list to move forward in the
list.

Fix this use-after-free thanks to two mechanisms:
- navigate in the list with list_for_each_entry_safe, which allows to
  safely modify the list as we go through each element. For each element,
  remove it from the list with list_del_rcu
- make sure to wait for RCU grace period end after each vif removal to make
  sure it is safe to free the corresponding vif too (through
  unregister_netdev)

Since we are in a RCU ""modifier"" path (not a ""reader"" path), and because
such path is expected not to be concurrent to any other modifier (we are
using the vif_mutex lock), we do not need to use RCU list API, that's why
we can benefit from list_for_each_entry_safe.

is obvious in this function: memory allocated by ieee80211_beacon_get()
is never released. Fixing this leak makes kmemleak happy.

        ","## CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation:

**CVE Description:**  wifi: ath9k: delay all of ath9k_wmi_event_tasklet() until init is complete

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

This vulnerability arises due to a race condition in the ath9k_htc driver within the Linux kernel. The `ath9k_wmi_event_tasklet()` function assumes data structures are fully initialized before execution, but the device can be exposed to the USB subsystem before driver initialization is complete. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference, potentially causing a denial of service or other unpredictable behavior. 

**CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N) - The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the network.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L) - The vulnerability can be exploited with little effort.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N) - No user interaction or privileges are required for exploitation.
* **User Interaction (UI):** None (N) - No user interaction is required for exploitation.
* **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U) - The exploit does not require any changes in scope.
* **Confidentiality (C):** None (N) - The vulnerability does not directly impact confidentiality.
* **Integrity (I):** Low (L) - The vulnerability could potentially lead to data corruption or integrity issues.
* **Availability (A):** High (H) - The vulnerability could lead to a denial of service condition.

Bluetooth: rfcomm: Fix null-ptr-deref in rfcomm_check_security

During our fuzz testing of the connection and disconnection process at the
RFCOMM layer, we discovered this bug. By comparing the packets from a
normal connection and disconnection process with the testcase that
triggered a KASAN report. We analyzed the cause of this bug as follows:

1. In the packets captured during a normal connection, the host sends a
`Read Encryption Key Size` type of `HCI_CMD` packet
(Command Opcode: 0x1408) to the controller to inquire the length of
encryption key.After receiving this packet, the controller immediately
replies with a Command Completepacket (Event Code: 0x0e) to return the
Encryption Key Size.

2. In our fuzz test case, the timing of the controller's response to this
packet was delayed to an unexpected point: after the RFCOMM and L2CAP
layers had disconnected but before the HCI layer had disconnected.

3. After receiving the Encryption Key Size Response at the time described
in point 2, the host still called the rfcomm_check_security function.
However, by this time `struct l2cap_conn *conn = l2cap_pi(sk)->chan->conn;`
had already been released, and when the function executed
`return hci_conn_security(conn->hcon, d->sec_level, auth_type, d->out);`,

soc: qcom: pmic_glink_altmode: fix drm bridge use-after-free

A recent DRM series purporting to simplify support for ""transparent
bridges"" and handling of probe deferrals ironically exposed a
use-after-free issue on pmic_glink_altmode probe deferral.

This has manifested itself as the display subsystem occasionally failing
to initialise and NULL-pointer dereferences during boot of machines like
the Lenovo ThinkPad X13s.

Specifically, the dp-hpd bridge is currently registered before all
resources have been acquired which means that it can also be
deregistered on probe deferrals.

In the meantime there is a race window where the new aux bridge driver
(or PHY driver previously) may have looked up the dp-hpd bridge and
stored a (non-reference-counted) pointer to the bridge which is about to
be deallocated.

When the display controller is later initialised, this triggers a
use-after-free when attaching the bridges:

	dp -> aux -> dp-hpd (freed)

which may, for example, result in the freed bridge failing to attach:

	[drm:drm_bridge_attach [drm]] *ERROR* failed to attach bridge /soc@0/phy@88eb000 to encoder TMDS-31: -16

or a NULL-pointer dereference:

	Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000
	...

	  dp_bridge_init+0xa8/0x15c [msm]
	  msm_dp_modeset_init+0x28/0xc4 [msm]

The DRM bridge implementation is clearly fragile and implicitly built on
the assumption that bridges may never go away. In this case, the fix is
to move the bridge registration in the pmic_glink_altmode driver to
after all resources have been looked up.

Incidentally, with the new dp-hpd bridge implementation, which registers
child devices, this is also a requirement due to a long-standing issue
in driver core that can otherwise lead to a probe deferral loop (see
commit fbc35b45f9f6 (""Add documentation on meaning of -EPROBE_DEFER"")).

inet: inet_defrag: prevent sk release while still in use

This affects skb fragments reassembled via netfilter or similar

Eric Dumazet made an initial analysis of this bug.  Quoting Eric:
  Calling ip_defrag() in output path is also implying skb_orphan(),

  net/ipv4/ip_output.c depends on skb->sk being set, and probably to an
  inet socket, not an arbitrary one.

  If we orphan the packet in ipvlan, then downstream things like FQ
  packet scheduler will not work properly.

  We need to change ip_defrag() to only use skb_orphan() when really
  needed, ie whenever frag_list is going to be used.

Eric suggested to stash sk in fragment queue and made an initial patch.
However there is a problem with this:

If skb is refragmented again right after, ip_do_fragment() will copy
head->sk to the new fragments, and sets up destructor to sock_wfree.

fully reassembled skb, else wmem will underflow.

This change moves the orphan down into the core, to last possible moment.
As ip_defrag_offset is aliased with sk_buff->sk member, we must move the
offset into the FRAG_CB, else skb->sk gets clobbered.

This allows to delay the orphaning long enough to learn if the skb has
to be queued or if the skb is completing the reasm queue.

In the former case, things work as before, skb is orphaned.  This is
safe because skb gets queued/stolen and won't continue past reasm engine.

The system was under memory stress where driver was not able to allocate an
SRB to carry out error recovery of cable pull.  The failure to flush causes
upper layer to start modifying scsi_cmnd.  When the system frees up some
memory, the subsequent cable pull trigger another command flush. At this
point the driver access a null pointer when attempting to DMA unmap the
SGL.

Add a check to make sure commands are flush back on session tear down to
prevent the null pointer access.

scsi: core: Fix unremoved procfs host directory regression

Commit fc663711b944 (""scsi: core: Remove the /proc/scsi/${proc_name}

adding a call to scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on scsi_remove_host(). But that led
to a potential duplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's also
called from scsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report,
which was then fixed by commit be03df3d4bfe (""scsi: core: Fix a procfs host
directory removal regression""). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() call
from dev_release().

But it happens that this proc directory is created on scsi_host_alloc(),
and that function ""pairs"" with scsi_host_dev_release(), while
scsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, it seems the
reason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meant to cover
cases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the call to
scsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in some
error paths, for example.

Syzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadget device, error'ing on
usb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checking that path, we can see
that the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put() after a SCSI host
allocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() in such path. That leads
to messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of the SCSI host proc

Originally, with strict in order execution, we could complete execution
only when the queue was empty. Preempt-to-busy allows replacement of an
active request that may complete before the preemption is processed by
HW. If that happens, the request is retired from the queue, but the
queue_priority_hint remains set, preventing direct submission until
after the next CS interrupt is processed.

This preempt-to-busy race can be triggered by the heartbeat, which will
also act as the power-management barrier and upon completion allow us to
idle the HW. We may process the completion of the heartbeat, and begin
parking the engine before the CS event that restores the
queue_priority_hint, causing us to fail the assertion that it is MIN.

drm/i915/gt: Reset queue_priority_hint on parking

Originally, with strict in order execution, we could complete execution
only when the queue was empty. Preempt-to-busy allows replacement of an
active request that may complete before the preemption is processed by
HW. If that happens, the request is retired from the queue, but the
queue_priority_hint remains set, preventing direct submission until
after the next CS interrupt is processed.

This preempt-to-busy race can be triggered by the heartbeat, which will
also act as the power-management barrier and upon completion allow us to
idle the HW. We may process the completion of the heartbeat, and begin
parking the engine before the CS event that restores the
queue_priority_hint, causing us to fail the assertion that it is MIN.

        ","## CVSS v3.1 Analysis:

**CVE Description:**  This vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel's DRM i915 driver and concerns a race condition that can lead to an assertion failure during engine parking. This occurs when a preempted request completes before the preemption is processed by the hardware. As a result, the queue priority hint remains set, preventing direct submission until after the next CS interrupt is processed. This can trigger a BUG_ON assertion when the heartbeat attempts to park the engine.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):** Local (L) - The vulnerability requires local access to the system.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L) - The race condition can be triggered with minimal effort.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N) -  The vulnerability does not require any special privileges to exploit.
* **User Interaction (UI):** None (N) -  The vulnerability does not require user interaction.
* **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U) - The vulnerability does not change the scope of the attack.
* **Confidentiality (C):** None (N) - The vulnerability does not directly impact confidentiality.
* **Integrity (I):** High (H) - The assertion failure leads to a kernel panic and potential data corruption.
* **Availability (A):** High (H) - The kernel panic causes a system crash, leading to a denial of service.

That has been tracked down to be happening when another thread is
deactivating the VMA inside __active_retire() helper, after the VMA's
active counter has been already decremented to 0, but before deactivation
of the VMA's object is reported to the object debugging tool.

We could prevent from that race by serializing i915_active_fini() with
__active_retire() via ref->tree_lock, but that wouldn't stop the VMA from
being used, e.g. from __i915_vma_retire() called at the end of
__active_retire(), after that VMA has been already freed by a concurrent
i915_vma_destroy() on return from the i915_active_fini().  Then, we should
rather fix the issue at the VMA level, not in i915_active.

Since __i915_vma_parked() is called from __gt_park() on last put of the
GT's wakeref, the issue could be addressed by holding the GT wakeref long
enough for __active_retire() to complete before that wakeref is released
and the GT parked.

I believe the issue was introduced by commit d93939730347 (""drm/i915:
Remove the vma refcount"") which moved a call to i915_active_fini() from
a dropped i915_vma_release(), called on last put of the removed VMA kref,
to i915_vma_parked() processing path called on last put of a GT wakeref.
However, its visibility to the object debugging tool was suppressed by a
bug in i915_active that was fixed two weeks later with commit e92eb246feb9
(""drm/i915/active: Fix missing debug object activation"").

A VMA associated with a request doesn't acquire a GT wakeref by itself.
Instead, it depends on a wakeref held directly by the request's active
intel_context for a GT associated with its VM, and indirectly on that
intel_context's engine wakeref if the engine belongs to the same GT as the
VMA's VM.  Those wakerefs are released asynchronously to VMA deactivation.

Fix the issue by getting a wakeref for the VMA's GT when activating it,
and putting that wakeref only after the VMA is deactivated.  However,
exclude global GTT from that processing path, otherwise the GPU never goes
idle.  Since __i915_vma_retire() may be called from atomic contexts, use
async variant of wakeref put.  Also, to avoid circular locking dependency,
take care of acquiring the wakeref before VM mutex when both are needed.

v7: Add inline comments with justifications for:
    - using untracked variants of intel_gt_pm_get/put() (Nirmoy),
    - using async variant of _put(),
    - not getting the wakeref in case of a global GTT,
    - always getting the first wakeref outside vm->mutex.
v6: Since __i915_vma_active/retire() callbacks are not serialized, storing
    a wakeref tracking handle inside struct i915_vma is not safe, and
    there is no other good place for that.  Use untracked variants of
    intel_gt_pm_get/put_async().
