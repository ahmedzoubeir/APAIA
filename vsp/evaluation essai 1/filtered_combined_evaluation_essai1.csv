```

Where:

* **Impact = (10.0 * (C + I + A) / 3) / 10.0**
* **Exploitability = (8.22 * (AV + AC + PR + UI) / 4) / 10.0**

In this case:

* **Impact = (10.0 * (3 + 3 + 3) / 3) / 10.0 = 3.0**
* **Exploitability = (8.22 * (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4) / 10.0 = 2.055**

**CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation:**

**Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)** - The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a network connection.

**Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)** - The attacker doesn't need to perform complex actions to exploit the vulnerability.

**Privileges Required (PR): None (N)** - No specific privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**User Interaction (UI): None (N)** - The vulnerability can be exploited without user interaction.

**Scope (S): Unchanged (U)** - The vulnerability exploits a single component or element without affecting the entire system.

**Confidentiality (C): Low (L)** - The attacker can potentially gain access to low-level confidential information.

**Integrity (I): High (H)** - The attacker can potentially modify data or system state.

**Availability (A): High (H)** - The attacker can potentially cause a denial of service.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation:**

The CVSS v3.1 base score is calculated using the following formula:

```
Base Score = (0.6 * Impact) * (0.6 * Exploitability)
```

Where:

* Impact = (1 * C) + (1 * I) + (1 * A)
* Exploitability = (0.85 * AV) * (0.62 * AC) * (0.55 * PR) * (0.68 * UI)

In this case:

* Impact = (1 * 1) + (1 * 3) + (1 * 3) = 7
* Exploitability = (0.85 * 0.85) * (0.62 * 0.75) * (0.55 * 1) * (0.68 * 1) = 0.21

Therefore, the CVSS v3.1 Base Score = (0.6 * 7) * (0.6 * 0.21) = **0.53** (rounded to two decimal places).

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26586,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix stack corruption

When tc filters are first added to a net device, the corresponding local
port gets bound to an ACL group in the device. The group contains a list
of ACLs. In turn, each ACL points to a different TCAM region where the
filters are stored. During forwarding, the ACLs are sequentially
evaluated until a match is found.

One reason to place filters in different regions is when they are added
with decreasing priorities and in an alternating order so that two
consecutive filters can never fit in the same region because of their
key usage.

In Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs the firmware started to report that the
maximum number of ACLs in a group is more than 16, but the layout of the
register that configures ACL groups (PAGT) was not updated to account
for that. It is therefore possible to hit stack corruption [1] in the
rare case where more than 16 ACLs in a group are required.

Fix by limiting the maximum ACL group size to the minimum between what
the firmware reports and the maximum ACLs that fit in the PAGT register.

Add a test case to make sure the machine does not crash when this
condition is hit.

* **Attack Complexity (AC):** **Low (L)** -  The vulnerability can be exploited with minimal effort. 
* **Privileges Required (PR):** **None (N)** -  Exploitation does not require any special privileges.
* **User Interaction (UI):** **None (N)** - The vulnerability does not require user interaction to exploit. 
* **Scope (S):** **Unchanged (U)** -  The vulnerability does not affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of other resources outside of the netdevsim device.
* **Confidentiality (C):** **None (N)** - The vulnerability does not directly impact confidentiality. 
* **Integrity (I):** **High (H)** - The vulnerability leads to a kernel crash, resulting in a denial of service and potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution.
* **Availability (A):** **High (H)** - The vulnerability causes a kernel crash, leading to a denial of service.

**CVE Description:**  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

`sched/membarrier: reduce the ability to hammer on sys_membarrier`

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

This vulnerability relates to the `sys_membarrier` system call in the Linux kernel. The issue is that the call can be very expensive on some systems, causing performance degradation. To mitigate this, a lock is implemented to serialize accesses and prevent excessive frequency of calls. This suggests a **denial of service** vulnerability. 

**CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):**  **Network (N)** -  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the `sys_membarrier` system call.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** **Low (L)** -  The exploit is relatively simple, requiring only sending malicious requests to the system call.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** **None (N)** -  Exploitation does not require any special privileges.
* **User Interaction (UI):**  **None (N)** -  The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction.
* **Scope (S):** **Unchanged (U)** - The vulnerability impacts the availability of the system, but does not change the scope of the attack.
* **Confidentiality (C):**  **None (N)** - The vulnerability does not directly impact confidentiality.
* **Integrity (I):** **None (N)** - The vulnerability does not directly impact integrity.
* **Availability (A):** **High (H)** -  The vulnerability can cause denial of service by saturating the system with excessive calls to `sys_membarrier`.

x86/fpu: Stop relying on userspace for info to fault in xsave buffer

Before this change, the expected size of the user space buffer was
taken from fx_sw->xstate_size. fx_sw->xstate_size can be changed
from user-space, so it is possible construct a sigreturn frame where:

 * fx_sw->xstate_size is smaller than the size required by valid bits in
   fx_sw->xfeatures.
 * user-space unmaps parts of the sigrame fpu buffer so that not all of

x86/fpu: Stop relying on userspace for info to fault in xsave buffer

Before this change, the expected size of the user space buffer was
taken from fx_sw->xstate_size. fx_sw->xstate_size can be changed
from user-space, so it is possible construct a sigreturn frame where:

 * fx_sw->xstate_size is smaller than the size required by valid bits in
   fx_sw->xfeatures.
 * user-space unmaps parts of the sigrame fpu buffer so that not all of
   the buffer required by xrstor is accessible.

In this case, xrstor tries to restore and accesses the unmapped area
which results in a fault. But fault_in_readable succeeds because buf +
fx_sw->xstate_size is within the still mapped area, so it goes back and
tries xrstor again. It will spin in this loop forever.

Instead, fault in the maximum size which can be touched by XRSTOR (taken
from fpstate->user_size).

        ","## CVE Description Analysis and CVSS v3.1 Calculation

**CVE Description:** This vulnerability occurs in the Linux kernel within the `ip_tunnel_rcv()` function, where the inner header is not properly handled leading to an uninitialized value. This issue arises due to the `pskb_inet_may_pull()` function, which is responsible for ensuring necessary headers are present within the `skb->head` pointer, but does not update the `skb->network_header` pointer accordingly. This discrepancy can result in the `network_header` pointer pointing to an uninitialized memory location, potentially leading to a system crash or other unforeseen consequences.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)** - The vulnerability is exploitable through a network connection.
* **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)** - An attacker with basic network access can exploit this vulnerability.
* **Privileges Required (PR): None (N)** - No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
* **User Interaction (UI): None (N)** - No user interaction is required for exploitation.
* **Scope (S): Unchanged (U)** - The vulnerability does not impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the entire system.
* **Confidentiality (C): None (N)** - The vulnerability does not directly compromise confidentiality.
* **Integrity (I): High (H)** - The vulnerability can potentially lead to a system crash, affecting integrity.
* **Availability (A): High (H)** - A system crash caused by this vulnerability would render the system unavailable.

        ","## CVSS v3.1 Base Score Analysis

**CVE Description:** In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

*bpf: Fix hashtab overflow check on 32-bit arches*

**Analysis:**

The vulnerability arises from a potential overflow during the calculation of hash buckets in the Linux kernel's hashtab code on 32-bit architectures. This overflow could be triggered by user input that leads to the creation of a large number of hash buckets, exceeding the capacity of the 32-bit data type.

**Base Metric Values:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):** **Network (N)** - The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, as the hashtab code is accessible over the network.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** **Low (L)** -  The vulnerability can be exploited with minimal effort and technical skills.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** **None (N)** - The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
* **User Interaction (UI):** **None (N)** - The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction.
* **Scope (S):** **Unchanged (U)** - The vulnerability does not require any changes in the security context of the attacker.
* **Confidentiality (C):** **High (H)** -  The vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of confidential information by allowing an attacker to access the kernel's memory.
* **Integrity (I):** **High (H)** - The vulnerability could allow an attacker to modify kernel data or even execute arbitrary code.
* **Availability (A):** **High (H)** -  The vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service by crashing the kernel or causing it to become unresponsive.

aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts

This patch is against CVE-2023-6270. The description of cve is:

  A flaw was found in the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux
  kernel. The aoecmd_cfg_pkts() function improperly updates the refcnt on
  `struct net_device`, and a use-after-free can be triggered by racing
  between the free on the struct and the access through the `skbtxq`
  global queue. This could lead to a denial of service condition or
  potential code execution.

In aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), it always calls dev_put(ifp) when skb initial
code is finished. But the net_device ifp will still be used in
later tx()->dev_queue_xmit() in kthread. Which means that the
dev_put(ifp) should NOT be called in the success path of skb
initial code in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). Otherwise tx() may run into
use-after-free because the net_device is freed.

This patch removed the dev_put(ifp) in the success path in
aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), and added dev_put() after skb xmit in tx().",7.8 HIGH,CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H,"

This patch is against CVE-2023-6270. The description of cve is:

  A flaw was found in the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux
  kernel. The aoecmd_cfg_pkts() function improperly updates the refcnt on
  `struct net_device`, and a use-after-free can be triggered by racing
  between the free on the struct and the access through the `skbtxq`
  global queue. This could lead to a denial of service condition or
  potential code execution.

In aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), it always calls dev_put(ifp) when skb initial
code is finished. But the net_device ifp will still be used in
later tx()->dev_queue_xmit() in kthread. Which means that the
dev_put(ifp) should NOT be called in the success path of skb
initial code in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). Otherwise tx() may run into
use-after-free because the net_device is freed.

This patch removed the dev_put(ifp) in the success path in
aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), and added dev_put() after skb xmit in tx().

block: fix deadlock between bd_link_disk_holder and partition scan

'open_mutex' of gendisk is used to protect open/close block devices. But

Bluetooth: rfcomm: Fix null-ptr-deref in rfcomm_check_security

During our fuzz testing of the connection and disconnection process at the
RFCOMM layer, we discovered this bug. By comparing the packets from a
normal connection and disconnection process with the testcase that
triggered a KASAN report. We analyzed the cause of this bug as follows:

1. In the packets captured during a normal connection, the host sends a
`Read Encryption Key Size` type of `HCI_CMD` packet
(Command Opcode: 0x1408) to the controller to inquire the length of
encryption key.After receiving this packet, the controller immediately
replies with a Command Completepacket (Event Code: 0x0e) to return the
Encryption Key Size.

2. In our fuzz test case, the timing of the controller's response to this
packet was delayed to an unexpected point: after the RFCOMM and L2CAP
layers had disconnected but before the HCI layer had disconnected.

3. After receiving the Encryption Key Size Response at the time described
in point 2, the host still called the rfcomm_check_security function.
However, by this time `struct l2cap_conn *conn = l2cap_pi(sk)->chan->conn;`
had already been released, and when the function executed
`return hci_conn_security(conn->hcon, d->sec_level, auth_type, d->out);`,
specifically when accessing `conn->hcon`, a null-ptr-deref error occurred.

To fix this bug, check if `sk->sk_state` is BT_CLOSED before calling
rfcomm_recv_frame in rfcomm_process_rx.",5.5 MEDIUM,CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H,"

soc: qcom: pmic_glink_altmode: fix drm bridge use-after-free

A recent DRM series purporting to simplify support for ""transparent
bridges"" and handling of probe deferrals ironically exposed a
use-after-free issue on pmic_glink_altmode probe deferral.

This has manifested itself as the display subsystem occasionally failing
to initialise and NULL-pointer dereferences during boot of machines like
the Lenovo ThinkPad X13s.

Specifically, the dp-hpd bridge is currently registered before all
resources have been acquired which means that it can also be
deregistered on probe deferrals.

In the meantime there is a race window where the new aux bridge driver
(or PHY driver previously) may have looked up the dp-hpd bridge and
stored a (non-reference-counted) pointer to the bridge which is about to
be deallocated.

When the display controller is later initialised, this triggers a
use-after-free when attaching the bridges:

	dp -> aux -> dp-hpd (freed)

which may, for example, result in the freed bridge failing to attach:

	[drm:drm_bridge_attach [drm]] *ERROR* failed to attach bridge /soc@0/phy@88eb000 to encoder TMDS-31: -16

or a NULL-pointer dereference:

	Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000
	...

	  drm_bridge_attach+0x70/0x1a8 [drm]

	  dp_bridge_init+0xa8/0x15c [msm]
	  msm_dp_modeset_init+0x28/0xc4 [msm]

The DRM bridge implementation is clearly fragile and implicitly built on
the assumption that bridges may never go away. In this case, the fix is
to move the bridge registration in the pmic_glink_altmode driver to
after all resources have been looked up.

Incidentally, with the new dp-hpd bridge implementation, which registers
child devices, this is also a requirement due to a long-standing issue
in driver core that can otherwise lead to a probe deferral loop (see
commit fbc35b45f9f6 (""Add documentation on meaning of -EPROBE_DEFER"")).

USB: core: Fix deadlock in usb_deauthorize_interface()

Among the attribute file callback routines in

the only one which acquires a device lock on an ancestor device: It
calls usb_deauthorize_interface(), which locks the interface's parent
USB device.

The will lead to deadlock if another process already owns that lock
and tries to remove the interface, whether through a configuration
change or because the device has been disconnected.  As part of the
removal procedure, device_del() waits for all ongoing sysfs attribute
callbacks to complete.  But usb_deauthorize_interface() can't complete
until the device lock has been released, and the lock won't be

to use the sysfs_break_active_protection() function, which tells sysfs
not to wait for the attribute callback.
