In Yocto Projects Bitbake before 2.6.2 (before and included Yocto Project 4.3.1), with the Toaster server (included in bitbake) running, missing input validation allows an attacker to perform a remote code execution in the server's shell via a crafted HTTP request. Authentication is not necessary. Toaster server execution has to be specifically run and is not the default for Bitbake command line builds, it is only used for the Toaster web based user interface to Bitbake. The fix has been backported to the bitbake included with Yocto Project 5.0, 3.1.31, 4.0.16, and 4.3.2.

Since no CVE description is provided, we cannot determine the accurate CVSS v3.1 Base Score. To do so, we need information about the vulnerability, such as:

* **Vulnerability type:**  What type of vulnerability is it (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting)? 
* **Affected software:**  What software or system is affected by the vulnerability?
* **Exploitation details:**  How can the vulnerability be exploited? What are the requirements for exploitation?

**Without this information, we cannot accurately assess the CVSS v3.1 metrics.**

**Example:** 

Let's assume a hypothetical vulnerability in a web application:

* **Vulnerability type:** Cross-site scripting (XSS)
* **Affected software:** A popular e-commerce website
* **Exploitation details:** The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into user comments, which can then be executed by other users visiting the website.

Based on this example, we could assess the CVSS v3.1 metrics as follows:

* **AV: N** (Network) - The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
* **AC: L** (Low) - The attack complexity is low, as the attacker only needs to inject malicious code.
* **PR: N** (None) - No privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
* **UI: R** (Required) - User interaction is required, as the user must visit the website to execute the malicious code.
* **S: U** (Unchanged) - The vulnerability does not change the security context of the attacker.
* **C: L** (Low) - The confidentiality impact is low, as the attacker can potentially steal sensitive information such as cookies.
* **I: H** (High) - The integrity impact is high, as the attacker can modify the website's content or behavior.
* **A: L** (Low) - The availability impact is low, as the attacker might be able to cause temporary interruptions by injecting malicious scripts.

**CVE Description:** In the Linux kernel through 6.9, an untrusted hypervisor can inject virtual interrupts 0 and 14 at any point in time and can trigger the SIGFPE signal handler in userspace applications. This affects AMD SEV-SNP and AMD SEV-ES.

**Base Metric Analysis:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):**  **Adjacent (A)** - The exploit requires the attacker to have access to the adjacent network, which in this case is the hypervisor.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** **Low (L)** - The attacker does not need to perform complex actions to exploit the vulnerability. The injection of virtual interrupts is relatively straightforward.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** **High (H)** - The exploit requires high privileges, specifically control over the hypervisor. 
* **User Interaction (UI):** **None (N)** - The exploit does not require user interaction. The hypervisor can inject interrupts autonomously.
* **Scope (S):** **Unchanged (U)** - The exploit does not change the scope of the attack. It remains confined to the affected system.
* **Confidentiality (C):** **High (H)** - The exploit allows the attacker to potentially gain access to confidential information stored in the userspace application.
* **Integrity (I):** **High (H)** - The exploit allows the attacker to potentially modify the integrity of data stored in the userspace application by manipulating the application's execution flow.
* **Availability (A):** **High (H)** - The exploit can cause the userspace application to crash or malfunction, leading to a denial of service.

**CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation:**

The CVSS v3.1 base score is calculated using the formula and the provided metric values:

```
Base Score = (0.6 * Impact) * (0.6 * Exploitability)
Impact = (10.0 * (1 - (1 - Confidentiality/10.0) * (1 - Integrity/10.0) * (1 - Availability/10.0))) / 10.0
Exploitability = (8.22 * (1 - (1 - Attack Vector/10.0) * (1 - Attack Complexity/10.0) * (1 - Privileges Required/10.0) * (1 - User Interaction/10.0))) / 10.0
```

Plugging in the values:

```
Impact = (10.0 * (1 - (1 - 10.0/10.0) * (1 - 10.0/10.0) * (1 - 10.0/10.0))) / 10.0 = 10.0
Exploitability = (8.22 * (1 - (1 - 8.0/10.0) * (1 - 2.0/10.0) * (1 - 5.0/10.0) * (1 - 0.0/10.0))) / 10.0 = 5.754
Base Score = (0.6 * 10.0) * (0.6 * 5.754) = **20.7144**

**Since no CVE description is provided, we cannot determine the specific values for the CVSS v3.1 metrics.** 

To accurately calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score, we need information about the vulnerability.  

**Here's how we would approach the analysis with a real CVE description:**

1. **Read the CVE Description Carefully:** Analyze the description to understand the vulnerability's nature, how it can be exploited, and the potential impact.
2. **Determine the Attack Vector (AV):** Consider how the attacker interacts with the vulnerable system (e.g., network, local, physical).
3. **Determine the Attack Complexity (AC):**  Evaluate the difficulty of executing the attack (e.g., low, high).
4. **Determine the Privileges Required (PR):**  Assess the privileges needed by the attacker (e.g., none, low, high).
5. **Determine the User Interaction (UI):**  Identify if user interaction is needed to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., none, required).
6. **Determine the Scope (S):**  Analyze whether the vulnerability affects a single instance or a larger scope (e.g., unchanged, changed).
7. **Determine the Impact:**
   - **Confidentiality (C):**  Evaluate the potential for unauthorized disclosure of data (e.g., none, low, high).
   - **Integrity (I):** Assess the potential for unauthorized modification of data (e.g., none, low, high).
   - **Availability (A):**  Evaluate the potential for denial of service (e.g., none, low, high).
8. **Calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** Use the CVSS v3.1 calculator with the determined metrics to obtain the base score.
9. **Construct the CVSS v3.1 Vector String:**  Combine the metric values into a string in the following format:

**Example format: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**

        ","## CVE Analysis: 

**Unfortunately, without a CVE description, it's impossible to accurately determine the CVSS v3.1 Base Score and the values for each metric.**

Here's why:

* **CVE Descriptions Provide Context:** The description provides information about the vulnerability, such as:
    * **The affected component:** Which software or system is vulnerable.
    * **The vulnerability type:**  What kind of flaw exists (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection).
    * **Exploitation details:** How an attacker might exploit the vulnerability.
    * **Impact:** What the consequences of exploitation could be (e.g., data disclosure, denial of service).
* **Metrics Depend on the Vulnerability:** The values for AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, and A are all determined based on the specific details of the vulnerability.

**To get a proper CVSS v3.1 Base Score, we need the CVE description.** 

**Example:**

Let's say the CVE description is for a vulnerability where a web server has a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability. A malicious user can send a crafted HTTP request to the server, leading to the execution of arbitrary code on the server.

Here's how the metrics might be assigned in this example:

* **AV: N** (Network) - The attack can be launched from anywhere on the network.
* **AC: L** (Low) - The crafted HTTP request is relatively easy to create and send.
* **PR: N** (None) - No privileges are required on the target system for the attack.
* **UI: N** (None) - No user interaction is required on the target system.
* **S: U** (Unchanged) - The vulnerability doesn't change the scope of the attack.
* **C: H** (High) - An attacker could potentially gain full control over the server.
* **I: H** (High) - An attacker could potentially modify the server's configuration or data.
* **A: H** (High) - The server could be completely unavailable due to the attack.

**CVSS v3.1 Vector String: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**

        ","Since there is no CVE description provided, we cannot accurately determine the CVSS v3.1 base score or the values for each base metric.  

To calculate a CVSS score, we need information about the vulnerability, such as:

* **How the vulnerability is exploited:**  Is it exploitable remotely (Network), over a local network (Adjacent), requires physical access to the system (Physical), or only exploitable by a local user (Local)?
* **How complex is the exploit:** Does the exploit require a high level of technical skill or is it relatively simple (Low)? 
* **What privileges are needed:** Does the attacker need administrative privileges (High), low-level privileges (Low), or no privileges at all (None)?
* **Does the vulnerability require user interaction:** Does the user need to click a link or open a malicious file (Required) or can the exploit work without user interaction (None)?
* **What impact does the vulnerability have:** Does the vulnerability allow the attacker to steal data (Confidentiality), modify data (Integrity), or make the system unavailable (Availability)?

* **How is the vulnerability exploited?** (e.g., network attack, local file access, etc.)
* **What are the potential impacts?** (e.g., data disclosure, system crash, denial of service, etc.)

**Without this information, we cannot determine the values for each base metric:**

* **Attack Vector (AV):**  We need to know how the vulnerability is exploited.
* **Attack Complexity (AC):** We need to understand the complexity of exploiting the vulnerability.
* **Privileges Required (PR):** We need to know the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability.
* **User Interaction (UI):** We need to know if user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
* **Scope (S):** We need to understand the scope of the vulnerability impact.
* **Confidentiality (C):** We need to assess the potential for data confidentiality breach.

The impact of the attack is reduced by the fact that the databases stored in this folder are encrypted. However, it contains some other potentially sensitive information, such as the FCM token. Forks of Element Android which have set `android:exported=""false""` in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file for the `IncomingShareActivity` activity are not impacted. This issue is fixed in Element Android 1.6.12. There is no known workaround to mitigate the issue.

Since no CVE description is provided, we can't determine the specific vulnerabilities and their impact. Therefore, we cannot accurately calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score or assign values to the individual metrics. 

**To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score, we need a clear understanding of the vulnerability's characteristics, including:**

* **How the vulnerability is exploited:** Is it through a network attack, local access, or physical interaction? 
* **The complexity of the exploit:** Is it easy or difficult to exploit?
* **What privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability?** Does the attacker need administrative privileges or can they exploit it with basic user privileges?
* **Does the exploit require user interaction?** 
* **What is the impact of the vulnerability?** Does it affect confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data or systems?

**Without this information, we cannot provide a meaningful CVSS v3.1 analysis.**

* **Privileges Required (PR):**  The vulnerability description does not specify any specific privileges required by the attacker. Therefore, we can assume **PR:N (None)**.
* **User Interaction (UI):**  This type of vulnerability typically does not require user interaction. Therefore, **UI:N (None)**.
* **Scope (S):**  Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities typically result in changing the scope of the attack. **S:C (Changed)**
* **Confidentiality (C):**  The vulnerability description does not explicitly mention data confidentiality impact. However, gaining elevated privileges could potentially allow the attacker to access sensitive data. Therefore, **C:H (High)**.
* **Integrity (I):**  Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities allow attackers to modify system files and configurations. Therefore, **I:H (High)**.
* **Availability (A):**  Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities can be used to disrupt system availability, such as through denial-of-service attacks. Therefore, **A:H (High)**.
