Microsoft was notified that an elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Windows based systems supporting Virtualization Based Security (VBS), including a subset of Azure Virtual Machine SKUS. This vulnerability enables an attacker with administrator privileges to replace current versions of Windows system files with outdated versions. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could reintroduce previously mitigated vulnerabilities, circumvent some features of VBS, and exfiltrate data protected by VBS.
Microsoft is developing a security update to mitigate this threat, but it is not yet available. Guidance to help customers reduce the risks associated with this vulnerability and to protect their systems until the mitigation is available in a Windows security update is provided in the Recommended Actions section of this CVE.
This CVE will be updated when the mitigation is available in a Windows security update. We highly encourage customers to subscribe to Security Update Guide notifications to receive an alert when this update occurs.
Update: August 13, 2024
Microsoft has released the August 2024 security updates that include an opt-in revocation policy mitigation to address this vulnerability. Customers running affected versions of Windows are encouraged to review KB5042562: Guidance for blocking rollback of virtualization-based security related updates to assess if this opt-in policy meets the needs of their environment before implementing this mitigation. There are risks associated with this mitigation that should be understood prior to applying it to your systems. Detailed information about these risks is also available in KB5042562.
Details:
A security researcher informed Microsoft of an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server 2016, and higher based systems including Azure Virtual Machines (VM) that support VBS. For more information on Windows versions and VM SKUs supporting VBS, reference: Virtualization-based Security (VBS) | Microsoft Learn.
The vulnerability enables an attacker with administrator privileges on the target system to replace current Windows system files with outdated versions. Successful exploitation provides an attacker with the ability to reintroduce previously mitigated vulnerabilities, circumvent VBS security features, and exfiltrate data protected by VBS.
Microsoft is developing a security update that will revoke outdated, unpatched VBS system files to mitigate this...",CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H,"## CVSS v3.1 Base Score Analysis

* **Attack Complexity (AC):** The description states a ""failed unmap operation,"" implying that attackers need to trigger this specific condition. This suggests a degree of technical knowledge and possibly a specific input or action. Thus, it is likely **Low (L)**.
* **Privileges Required (PR):**  The vulnerability is in the GPU driver, meaning attackers would need to run code with the same privileges as the driver. This is typically a high privilege level. Thus, **High (H)**.
* **User Interaction (UI):** The vulnerability description doesn't mention any requirement for user interaction. Therefore, it is **None (N)**.
* **Scope (S):**  A failed unmap operation directly impacts the GPU and its memory, likely impacting the entire system. Therefore, the scope is **Changed (C)**.
* **Confidentiality (C):** Memory corruption can allow attackers to access sensitive information stored in the GPU's memory. Thus, **High (H)**.
* **Integrity (I):**  Memory corruption can allow attackers to modify data and potentially execute malicious code, leading to system compromise.  Thus, **High (H)**.
* **Availability (A):** A failed unmap operation could potentially crash the GPU or cause instability, leading to service disruption. Therefore, **High (H)**.

Continued BGP session flapping will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue only affects routers configured with non-stop routing (NSR) enabled. Graceful Restart (GR) helper mode, enabled by default, is also required for this issue to be exploitable.


Note: NSR is not supported on the SRX Series and is therefore not affected by this vulnerability.
When the BGP session flaps on the NSR-enabled router, the device enters GR-helper/LLGR-helper mode due to the peer having negotiated GR/LLGR-restarter capability and the backup BGP requests for replication of the GR/LLGR-helper session, master BGP schedules, and initiates replication of GR/LLGR stale routes to the backup BGP. In this state, if the BGP session with the BGP peer comes up again, unsolicited replication is initiated for the peer without cleaning up the ongoing GR/LLGR-helper mode replication. This parallel two instances of replication for the same peer leads to the assert if the BGP session flaps again.

This vulnerability does not affect Vapor directly but could impact applications relying on the URI type for validating user input. The URI type is used in several places in Vapor. A developer may decide to use URI to represent a URL in their application (especially if that URL is then passed to the HTTP Client) and rely on its public properties and methods. However, URI may fail to properly parse a valid (albeit abnormally long) URL, due to string ranges being converted to 16-bit integers. An attacker may use this behavior to trick the application into accepting a URL to an untrusted destination. By padding the port number with zeros, an attacker can cause an integer overflow to occur when the URL authority is parsed and, as a result, spoof the host.
